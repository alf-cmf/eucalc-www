["The number of people in the world has a big impact on the energy and land system, as a higher population will increase demand for food, manufactured goods, transport, and buildings. However, the future population growth trajectory is very uncertain. This lever allows you to explore the UN’s range of projections, so that you can see how this uncertainty impacts on emissions and temperature change.\r\rAccording to UN estimates, the world’s population was 6.9 billion in 2011, and by 2014 it was increasing by about 82 million each year. Fertility in developing countries has fallen over the last two decades. However, because birth rates in developing countries tend to be much higher than in developed ones, and because of their younger population structures, it is expected that most of the growth between now and 2050 will be concentrated in developing regions. This means that the total population in 2050 will depend particularly on how fertility changes in developing countries over the next few decades.","由于更多的人口将增加对食物、制成品、交通运输以及建筑物的需求，世界人口规模对能源和土地的利用将产生深远影响。然而，未来的世界人口增长轨迹非常不确定。借助联合国世界人口预测，本条目将帮助你了解世界人口增速不确定性对排放及气候变化的影响。\r\r据联合国统计，2011年世界人口为69亿，2011年到2014年间每年世界人口增加约8200万。过去二十年间发展中国家的生育率已有所下降，然而由于发展中国家的出生率往往比发达国家高得多，并且他们的人口结构相对年轻,，预计从现在到2050年的新增世界人口将主要来自发展中国家和地区。这意味着2050年的世界人口规模将主要依赖于未来几十年发展中国家的生育率情况。"],
["Because population is such an important driver of demand, this lever affects almost all the other levers in the Global Calculator. This lever links with the urbanisation level, because energy trends in urban areas have historically been very different to rural areas.\r\rHistorically, fertility has generally fallen as countries develop and people get wealthier. Choosing a lower population growth rate using this lever could therefore simulate one of the effects of economic development. \r\rBecause of these reductions in fertility and increased life expectancies, most countries in the world now have ageing populations. This ageing could have negative impacts on economies in the future, as health and pension costs increase while the proportion of people of working age reduces. In developed countries, this ageing trend is more established and is already putting pressure on health and welfare budgets. Many developing countries are expected to enter a period of rapid ageing soon. Although reductions in fertility in the future would make it comparatively easier to tackle climate change, these negative impacts should also be taken into account when choosing a level for this lever.","由于人口规模是能源需求的重要驱动力，本条目的设置会影响全球计算器中的几乎所有其他条目。本条目与城市化水平有关，因为历史上城市地区与农村地区的能源消费迥然不同。\r\r历史上，伴随着国家的发展和人民变得富裕，生育率会有所下降。通过设定一个较低的人口增长率，本条目将帮助你模拟经济发展对人口增速方面的影响。\r\r由于生育率降低和预期寿命增加，世界上大多数国家的人口结构已经老龄化。随着医疗和养老金成本增加而劳动年龄人口比例减少，老龄化可能对经济前景产生负面作用。发达国家的人口老龄化趋势已成定局，并且对医疗和社会保障体系构成挑战。预计许多发展中国家也将进入快速老龄化的阶段。虽然未来生育率的降低有利于应对气候变化挑战，但选择本条目级别时也需要考虑到它潜在的负面影响。"],

["Urban areas have denser populations than rural ones, so urban lifestyles have the potential for greater energy efficiency because of smaller homes, shorter travel distances and greater access to public transport. However, in developing countries, urban areas usually offer a much higher standard of living than in rural areas, with increased access to electricity, consumer goods and cars. This means that urbanisation is a big driver of increased energy demand globally.\r\rIn 2011, 52% of the global population lived in urban areas. There has been a strong upward trend, as only 30% of people lived in towns and cities in 1950. Today, developed countries are more urbanised than developing ones, however many forecasts anticipate a big increase in urbanisation in developing countries over the next few decades as economies grow. Urban areas are expected to absorb all the population increase by 2050, and will also draw in some of the rural population.","由于城镇比农村人口密集，住房更小、出行距离更短、公共交通更发达，因此城镇生活方式有助于提高能源效率。然而发展中国家的城镇生活水平通常比农村高得多，进而增加了对电力、消费品和汽车的需求。这意味着城市化是全球能源需求增加的一个重要原因。\r\r1950年居住在城镇的世界人口比例为30%，到2011年这一比例达到52%，期间经历了强劲的增长。当前发达国家比发展中国家的城市化水平高，预计未来几十年，发展中国家的城市化进程将随着经济增长迅速展开。预计城镇地区将吸纳截至2050年的全部新增人口，以及一部分农村人口。"],
["Although urbanisation does increase energy demand per capita in developing countries, and therefore emissions, it often happens because of shortages of jobs in rural areas caused by agricultural modernisation, and growth in paid jobs in urban areas. Moving to towns or cities can also offer huge benefits to the people involved through better access to education, health care and entertainment. Lower urbanisation levels in the future could have a big impact on development.\r\rIf urbanisation is not properly planned, it can lead to urban sprawl and huge traffic problems, removing the energy efficiency benefit of living in more compact areas and also having a negative impact on quality of life. However if urban infrastructures are planned as cities grow, then energy demand per person can be reduced by designing smarter transport systems and providing housing for people closer to work.","尽管城市化提高了发展中国家的人均能源需求和排放，但由于农业现代化造成的农村地区工作机会短缺以及城市地区工作机会增加，城市化是不可避免的。搬到城镇生活也可以使居民得到更好的教育、医疗和娱乐服务。未来低城市化率将对发展产生重大影响。\r\r如果没有恰当的城市规划，经济发展将导致城市扩张和严重的交通拥堵，进而抵消城镇生活方式在提高能源效率方面的好处，影响生活质量。伴随着城市规模的扩大，合理规划基础设施、使用智能交通系统、为居民提供更接近住所的工作，都有助于降低人均能源需求。"],
["Under the level 1 scenario, 75% of the global population live in urban areas. This represents an acceleration of current urbanisation trends, particularly in developing countries. By 2050 the world average is similar to that of the developed world today. This is the high urbanisation estimate from the UN “World Population Prospects, the 2011 Revision”.","高城市化率情景：城市化进程加速，特别是在发展中国家。到2050年，75%的世界人口居住在城镇，世界平均城市化水平与目前的发达国家水平相当。"],

["Passenger transport includes transport of people by road, rail, air and ship.  Passenger transport accounted for 60% of total transport energy demand in 2011, with the remaining 40% for freight.  Historically, travel distance per person has steadily increased. Recently, in some areas, like major transit cities such as London, distance per person has stagnated. At the same time, there has been extremely fast growth in travel demand in cities within developing countries over recent decades. The Global Calculator model distinguishes between 6 different types of region which have different travel behaviour. Urban areas are classified as automobile cities (cities that are spread out, such as Los Angeles), transit cities (cities that are relatively compact, such as Paris) and booming cities (new or expanding cities, such as Mumbai). Rural areas are classed as developed or developing.  International travel is defined as long distance travel, by air or to some extent train.","客运包括公路、铁路、航空和船舶四种方式。客运占2011年交通能源需求总量的60%，其余40%为货运。从历史上看，人均出行距离增长稳健。近年来，在像伦敦这样的交通枢纽城市，人均出行距离保持相对稳定。同时，发展中国家的城市人均出行距离迅速增长。根据出行方式，全球计算器识别出6种类型的地区。其中，城镇地区被分为汽车城市（布局松散，例如洛杉矶）、枢纽城市（布局紧凑，例如巴黎）和新兴城市（新建或正在扩张城市，例如孟买）。农村地区被分为发达农村和发展中农村。国际出行是指通过航空或一定程度上的铁路运输进行的长途旅行。"],
["Historically, increases in travel demand have been correlated with growth in GDP. However, development of more flexible and digital working habits might diminish this correlation in the future. City planning can also have a significant impact on average distance travelled per person. The user may want to consider other transport levers at the same time as this. In particular, the “mode” lever determines what share of travel is made by car, train or plane; and the “occupancy & load” lever determines how many people are in the average car. Better city design can help to reduce both the passenger distance travelled and enable mode switch or boost car occupancy levels. Note that the “car own or hire” lever does not influence demand for car trips or car occupancy.  Instead, it allows the user to explore the cost implications of having fewer cars on the road through more car hire schemes.","从历史上看，出行需求的增长与国民生产总值（GDP）的增长相关。然而随着更灵活的远程工作模式的出现，这种相关性将被削弱。城市规划也将对人均出行距离产生重大影响。设置本条目时，您应当一并考虑其他有关运输的条目。具体来看，“出行模式”条目设置汽车、火车、航空出行的比例；“利用率和负荷度”条目设置平均车载乘客数。合理的城市规划不仅有助于减少乘客出行距离、便利换乘、而且可以提高道路占有率。特别需要说明的是，“自有或租用汽车”条目并不影响汽车出行需求和道路占有率，这一条目旨在帮助您了解租用而非自有汽车对公路交通成本的影响。"],

To do this, use the “freight by load” graphic in the web tool.  This shows growth in international freight by sea alongside growth in coal, oil and iron products between 2011 and 2050.  Coal, oil and iron products currently account for around two thirds of global international freight by sea (International Maritime Organisation (2009 based on UNCTAD data 2006)) so it is useful to check whether they follow similar trends.  Users can reduce demand for iron products by reducing the demand for manufactured products (e.g. reduce the number of cars using the “mode” lever).

["Historically, as countries become richer, car ownership levels increase. If people continue to own private vehicles at the current rate or increased rate, then we will have significantly more vehicles, but perhaps without intensive usage.  In some parts of the world, where many families own a car (or even two cars), these vehicles are often only used for a small proportion of the day and week. This is often expensive, and it may be that in future people begin to move away from owning their own vehicles.\r\rOne option in the future is hiring cars or motorbikes from a company or government scheme, or as an informal arrangements among households or neighbours, allowing people to drive similar distances as today, but using a fleet of shared vehicles.  Hiring a vehicle or car-sharing would decrease the stock of cars needed, and the associated manufacturing energy demand and emissions impacts. Signs of these trends are already emerging and some schemes have already achieved success in city areas.\r\rAn additional step could be self-driving or autonomous vehicles, which is a technology that could radically change the way we travel. They could offer all of the conveniences of taxis as well as maximizing the use time and road space, so if the cost become comparable or cheaper than owning a car, it could drastically decrease car ownership.

["Recently there has been a strong focus on improving the fuel efficiency of cars – for example, the fleet consumption of Daimler fell by about 50% between 1990 and 2012 to around 6.5 litres per 100 km. This was achieved by technology improvements (cylinder capacity and turbo charging) and regulatory efforts such as lower-limits for fleet efficiencies.\r\rIt may be harder for fossil-fuel-powered car engine efficiencies to make future improvements given the quick progress in the past few years. However, car efficiency could be improved by decreasing the average car weight so that less fuel is needed. Policy approaches might be able to increase average transport efficiency by setting more severe upper speed limits for cars which would run more efficiently at lower speeds – but this may not be politically acceptable.\r\rThe efficiency of planes has also improved over the last decades. The jumbo jet A380 is 12% more efficient than a Boeing 747.  Planes have been considerably optimised in the last years, possibly suggesting that fewer significant improvements can be expected. Replacing fossil fuel by hydrogen might not help to reduce the climate impact of flying as water vapour acts as a strong greenhouse gas. When directly emitted in the stratosphere, water vapour can persist for months and years and might also degrade the ozone layer. \r\rSignificant research efforts are going into low-emission vehicles, meaning that efficiency improvements are also likely for hydrogen-powered and electric vehicles.","近年来汽车的燃料效率得到广泛关注。例如，戴姆勒的每100公里油耗在1990年-2012年间下降了约50%，至6.5升的水平。这一进步来自技术革新（汽缸容积和涡轮增压）和对燃料效率下限的监管。\r\r考虑到过去几年的迅速进步，使用化石燃料的汽车引擎的燃料效率可能难以在未来进一步提升。然而，汽车运输效率可以通过减少平均汽车重量提高，因为此时燃料需求降低。设置更严格的车速限制，使车辆在较低车速下更高效地运行，也将提高汽车平均运输效率。但类似监管措施可能由于政治因素无法被采纳。\r\r飞机的运输效率也在过去几十年里有所提高。大型喷气式客机A380比波音747的效率提高12%。由于过去的大幅优化，预计未来飞机效率发生显著改善的可能性将减小。由于水蒸气是重要的温室气体，用氢动力代替化石燃料也不会对减少飞行的气候影响有所帮助。如果直接排放在平流层，水蒸气甚至可以保持数月乃至数年，并可能破坏臭氧层。\r\r由于在低排放车辆研究方面的大量努力，效率提高更可能发生在氢动力和电动汽车方面。"],
["This lever applies to all vehicles, and links with other choices made, especially “electric and hydrogen” and “occupancy and load”. There are several ways to enhance vehicle efficiency, such as improving the engine or aerodynamic performance of vehicles, using lighter materials to reduce the ratio weight per person, or changes in driving behaviour (for example, braking less or travelling at lower speeds).\r\rFossil fuel-powered transport can be divided into two main areas: passenger and freight transport. For passenger transport, public transport (especially electric trains, trams and buses) is about 5 to 10 times more energy-efficient than other forms of transport (e.g. cars and planes).\r\rFor freight transport, in 2011 light-duty vehicles had an efficiency of 10 litres gasoline equivalent (lge) per 100km and heavy-duty vehicle efficiency was 32 lge per 100km. The average global rate of improvement is 1-2% per year.

In general, however, homes in developing countries tend to be smaller than those in developed countries, and rural homes are smaller than urban ones on average.  \r\rThe floor area of non-residential buildings also varies a lot on a per capita basis from country to country. Developing countries tend to have less non-residential floor area per person than developed ones, as this is closely related to the development of the service economy.   \r\rIn the last fifty years, the total floor area of buildings in developed countries has increased significantly, but this growth has slowed in recent years. The fastest growth is now in developing countries. In China the average house size in 1978 was about 30.8 square meters, but in 2012 the average is about 89 square meters.","建筑物的大小会影响它的能源需求，特别是有多少能量需要加热或冷却。更大的房子往往比小一点的房子有更高的能源需求，因此减少了未来家庭的平均住宅面积可以对排放水平产生一定的影响。\r\r在2011年，城镇居民家庭的平均住宅面积为92 平方米，但国家与国家间的这一数值存在巨大差异。例如，澳大利亚的新建住房平均为214平方米，而在香港只有45平方米。一般情况下，发展中国家的平均住房面积往往比发达国家更小，农村的平均住房面积比城市的要小。\r\r人均非住宅建筑面积也因国而异。发展中国家的人均非住宅建筑面积往往比发达国家要少，这是由于这一数值与服务型经济的发展密切相关。\r\r在过去的五十年，发达国家的总建筑面积有了显著的增加，但这种增长势头在最近几年有所放缓。现在，增长最快的是在发展中国家。在中国，平均住宅面积在1978年约为30.8平方米，但在2012年该数值则达到89万平方米。"],

["Heating and cooling represent a large proportion of total energy demand of buildings (around 50% of demand in OECD countries). \r\rThe energy demand of a building will increase as room temperature moves further away from the outside temperature (i.e. through heating when it is cold outside, or using air conditioning when it is warm outside). By keeping room temperatures closer to the temperature outside, energy demand – and its associated emissions – can decrease greatly.\r\rHistorically, heating and cooling demand has increased in countries as they develop, as people have more money and technology available to spend on achieving a comfortable temperature in their homes and other buildings. For example, in the developed world, the average home temperature in the winter increased over the last few decades, and is now stabilising at around 21deg;C. There is potential for energy demand to grow in developing countries, particularly for cooling as these are concentrated in the warmest parts of the world. \r\rIt is possible to experience the same level of thermal comfort while reducing the average temperature. For example, this can be done by using “smart” heating controls that only heat or cool rooms when they are being used. Smart controls exist in different complexities, ranging from simple clock time systems that switch on the heating system only in mornings and evenings to sophisticated home automation systems. Behaviour change can also make a big difference. During the winter, wearing an extra layer of clothing can compensate for a 1.5deg;C drop in temperature. In Japan, a campaign called Cool Biz encouraged companies to set air conditioners to 28deg;C in offices, and asked workers to wear lighter clothing during the summer (with no jackets and ties). This resulted in significant reduction in electricity demand and emissions.","制冷和制热用能占据着建筑物能源需求总量的很大比例（在经合组织国家间约占到总需求的50%）。\r\r随着室内外温差的增大，建筑能源需求会不断增加（即室外较冷的时候，室内制热；室外较热的时候，室内制冷）。通过缩小室内外温差，能源需求——以及其相关排放——即可大大降低。\r\r从历史上看，制冷和制热需求随国家的发展而增加，因为人们有更加富裕的经济条件和更多可用的技术，用于将他们的住宅和其他建筑调整到一个舒适的温度。例如，在发达国家，在过去几十年中，家庭的冬季平均室温一直在增加，现在稳定在约21摄氏度左右。而发展中国家则存在潜在的能源需求的增长，特别是用于制冷，因为这些国家大都集中在全球最温暖的地带。\r\r在降低平均气温的同时，是有可能达到与原来相同的热舒适度的。例如，可以通过智能温控系统进行室温控制，使其只对正在使用的房间进行制冷或制热。智能温控系统可以运用不同的复杂性控制规则，从定时启动加热系统，只对早上和晚上供热的简单规则，到复杂的家庭自动化系统规则。行为方式的变化也可以带来很大的不同。在冬季，添一层衣服可以抵抗1.5摄氏度的气温下降。在日本，一个叫“清凉商务”的运动鼓励企业将办公室空调温度设置为28度，并且要求员工在夏季着更加轻便的服装（不需穿外套和领带）。这一举措带来了显著减少的电力需求和排放的结果。"],

["Space heating and cooling accounts for around 30% of all the energy demand of buildings globally. The amount of energy needed to heat or cool building can be reduced significantly by improving external walls, floors, roofs, ceilings, windows and doors so that the building is better insulated.

This process is called “retrofitting”. For new buildings, improvements are easier as better materials can be chosen from the outset. Governments can influence this by improving building standards. \r\rThe global average level of insulation has improved over the last few decades. The “passive house” standard has recently been developed and is the best technology available in terms of energy savings. This can reduce heating and cooling demand by 60% with minimal costs (e.g. in Germany, UK and USA the average price for a passive house is on average 5–10% higher than for conventional houses).","空间加热和制冷用能约占全球建筑能源需求总量的30%。通过提高建筑物外墙、地板、屋顶、天花板、门窗的封闭性和隔热性能，用于制热或制冷的建筑用能能够显著减少。这就意味着在天冷的时候，有更少的热量能够从建筑物内部散失，在天热的时候，有更少的热量能够从建筑物外部进入建筑以影响其制冷效果。\r\r对于现有的建筑物，热效率可通过更换密闭性更好的窗户或添加外墙和屋顶隔热层得到改善。这个过程被称为“改造”。对新建筑物改进就更加容易，只要一开始就选择更好的材料就可以了。政府可以通过提高建筑标准来进行干预。\r\r在过去的几十年，全球建筑物隔热性平均水平已经提高了很多。“被动式房屋”标准近期业已出台，为建筑物节能提供了最好的技术参考。这可以使建筑以其最小（改造）成本节约60%的制冷制热能源需求（例如，在德国、英国和美国，建设被动式房屋的平均价格只比传统房屋高出5-10%）。"],

This is particularly significant when efficiency of new products may be improving quickly each year.\r\rWhile the optimal replacement rates for energy and emission reductions will vary for different products, research estimated that people currently replace objects much more frequently than we would if our objective were to minimise energy inputs. There is therefore significant potential to save energy and emissions by extending the product lifespans. \r\rAs well as increasing product lifespan, global emissions and energy consumption could be reduced by reducing global consumption of products.

["There are several ways to increase the lifetime of products. Firstly, if products were made more durable, they could last longer before becoming degraded and no longer fit for use. For example, by heat-treating rail tracks, we could significantly increase wear resistance, and this has been shown to extend track life and hence reduce rail emissions by up to 50%. Products could be designed in a way that makes future upgrades much easier, allowing the product to keep pace with new designs (or fashion) without full replacement. Alternatively, when products are no longer required by one owner, more could be given or sold to new owners, rather than being thrown away. \r\rAs people get wealthier, they tend to consume more. However, if our global consumption pattern moved to consuming more service-based products (e.g. visiting spas, rather than going shopping), or more products that are less resource intensive (e.g. music and films in electronic form, rather than CDs and DVDs), it may be possible to partially decouple increased consumption from GDP growth and wellbeing, and hence reduce consumption of products per person by 2050.\r\rWithin the model, product demand is defined by other levers whenever possible. Some examples are:\r- Windmills & Solar PV demand are influenced by the “wind” and “solar” levers;\r- Buildings demand is influenced by “building size” lever;\r- Appliances demand is influenced by the “lighting and appliance use” lever;\r- Infrastructure demand is influenced by “passenger distance” lever;\r- Car, train & bus demand is influenced by the “transport mode” and “car ownership” levers;\r- Fertilizer demand is influenced by the agriculture “crop yields” lever.\rMost products are influenced by several levers and nearly all are influenced by the population.","有一下几种方法可以增加产品的使用寿命。首先，如果提升产品的耐用性，它们可以在老化退役或变得不再适合使用之前服役更长时间。例如，通过对铁轨进行热处理，我们可以显著提高它的耐磨性，这一举措已经被证实能够延长轨道的寿命，并减少最高达50%的排放。而且产品可以设计成在未来升级更容易的形式，使其在不被完全替代的情况下实现更新换代。或者在另一个层面，能够实现当产品不再被现在的拥有者所需要的时候，可以被赠与或出售给新的拥有者，而不是被丢弃。\r\r当人们变得越来越富裕的时候，往往会消耗更多。但是如果我们能够转变全球的消费模式，推荐消费更多的服务型产品（如去做水疗按摩，而不是去购物），或者至少是不那么资源密集型的产品（如音乐和电影以电子形式，而不是CD和DVD），则有可能实现消费增长与GDP增长和福利增加的部分脱钩，从而减少到2050年的人均产品消费量。\r\r在该模型中，产品的需求会随时被其他可能的条目所影响。据一些例子：\r-风电装机和太阳能光伏材料需求是由“风能”和“太阳能”条目影响的；\r-建筑耗能的需求是受“建筑面积”条目影响的；\r-家电耗能需求是受“照明和家电使用”条目影响的；\r-基础设施需求是受“乘客距离”条目影响的；\r-汽车、火车和公交车用能的需求是受“运输模式”和“汽车保有量”条目影响的；\r-化肥需求是受农业“作物产量”条目影响的。\r大部分产品都是受若干条目的共同影响，而且几乎所有的条目均受人口规模的影响。"],

["The carbon emissions and energy input associated with products, such as televisions (TVs) and cars, can be reduced in broadly three different ways. Firstly, design improvements, so that less material is required during product manufacture. Secondly, material switching, which involves either using less carbon-intensive materials for product manufacture, or making products from materials which improve the design of the product, therefore resulting in lower emissions from the use of the product during its lifespan. Thirdly, using more recycled materials can reduce energy and emissions.\r\rAllwood and Cullen (2012) estimated that by optimising product designs, we could use approximately 30% less metal per product globally, without affecting product quality. They also predicted that there would be potential to recycle 90% of steel and aluminium globally by optimising systems to maximise scrap collection and separation. There are similar opportunities to reduce the use of other virgin materials by design and increased re-use and recycling.","我们所使用的如电视机和汽车这类产品，与其相关的二氧化碳排放量和能源投入，可以大致用以下三种不同的方式减少。首先，改进设计，可以产品在制造过程中消耗更少的材料。其次，更换产品材料，使其要么使用更少的高碳排放材料制造，要么使用能够提高产品工艺的新材料制造，从而减少产品在全生命周期中的排放量。第三，使用更多的可再生材料可以降低能源消耗和排放。\r\r据Allwood and Cullen (2012) 估计，通过优化产品设计，我们可以在全球范围内每生产一个产品，就减少约30%的金属使用，而不会影响产品质量。他们还预测，通过全球系统优化，将有可能实现最大限度地提高废料收集和分离，以回收90%的钢和铝。而且有同样大的几率可以通过改进工艺和增加回收和再利用来减少初始原材料的使用量。"],
["Better design\rBy designing products with a specification to minimise material requirements, significant material savings could be achieved without compromising the technical requirements of the product. Examples of design improvements could be lighter steel and aluminium products (e.g. vehicles), buildings built with minimal structural steel, plastic products that are stronger and lighter than present, and optimising cement strengths.\rMaterial savings can also be achieved by improving manufacturing processes, so that less scrap is produced, and less material is required to make the same products. Currently, nearly half of all aluminium is converted into scrap rather than products in manufacturing processes.\r\rMaterial switching\rSwitching product materials to materials with lower greenhouse gas intensities could also reduce emissions from the manufacturing of goods. For example, cars and trucks could be manufactured in part from aluminium or carbon fibre rather than steel, planes could be made using carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, reducing their weight, or building structures could be made from timber rather than steel, to reduce the emission intensity of manufacture.\rIn the Global Calculator, material switching from steel to timber, steel to aluminium, steel to plastics, cement to timber, and cement to plastics are considered. However material substitution is highly complex, and there are other potential substitutions that are currently not modelled here.\rIt is important to note that there could be some disadvantages associated with the material switches modelled here: \r• Wood burns more easily and is less stable than steel and concrete. More wood is also required than metal to produce a product of considerable strength, however some of these limitations are now being addressed with new technologies such as cross lamination. \r• Timber can act as a ‘carbon sink’, with carbon from the atmosphere being stored in products. However, increasing timber demand could impact biodiversity, and the carbon stored in forests. Please refer to the land and food sector for the impacts of biomass.\r• Aluminium has significantly higher embodied energy and emissions associated with it than steel; however, it weighs much less than steel, so if used in vehicles the saving in weight can result in reduced fuel consumption. This leads to a trade-off between the up-front manufacturing energy for vehicles, and the energy used during a vehicle’s life-time.  \r\rRecycling\rFor steel, most recycled metals are currently produced from scrap generated during production, rather than post-consumer scrap; these wastes are generally well sorted, aiding recycling. However, post-consumer scrap is forecast to increase, therefore separation will become critical and to maximise metals recycling new technologies may be required, for example, to remove copper from recycled steel. Future aluminium recycling rates are expected to decrease, mainly because the availability of aluminium scrap is forecast to be limited in the future. Carbon fibre products are difficult to recycle.\rIt is currently very energy intensive to recycle concrete materials, therefore this is seldom practiced. However, concrete re-use may be more common in the future, particularly if more concrete components are made in standardised units.\rPaper is already widely recycled, with around 60% of all paper being recycled in Europe and North America. The rate of paper recycling has been increasing steadily over the past decade, and it is projected that this trend will increase as less developed countries start to recycle more in the future.\r\rIf you have chosen a high level for this lever, the improvements in design could also translate into higher vehicle efficiency, so you may want to consider choosing a high level for the ‘Transport Efficiency’ lever as well.\rTo ensure your scenario is consistent, we recommend setting “Iron, Steel and Aluminium lever” to the same value as this lever (Design, Materials and Recycling). This is because the chosen amount of recycling of steel defines the technologies used to manufacture steel products.","更好的设计\r更好的产品设计是使用规范的方式，将产品原料需求降到最低，在不影响产品技术需求的情况下实现原料的大量节约。改进设计的例子如使用轻钢和铝产品（如汽车），又如建筑建造中可以采用最少的钢结构设计，使用比目前结实且轻便的塑料产品以及优化水泥。材料的节约也可通过改善生产流程，以减少废料的产生和原料的使用。然而，目前的工业生产过程中将近一半的铝原料变成了工业废料而不是产品。原料替换\r\r将产品原料替换为较低温室气体排放强度的原料也可以减少产品生产过程中的排放。例如，汽车和千卡车可以部分采用比钢材更好的铝和碳纤维制造，飞机也可以使用比铝更好的碳纤维，且能减少重量，而建筑结构也可以采用部分的木材而不是钢材，以减少生产过程中的排放强度。\r在全球计算器中，原料的替换主要考虑木材对钢材的替换、铝对钢材的替换、塑料对钢材的替换、木材对水泥的替换以及塑料对水泥的替换。然而材料替换是高度复杂化的，还有很多潜在的替换存在，这些情况目前并不在计算器的模拟中体现。\r值得注意的是，这里的原料替换建模中可能会存在一些不足，如：\r木材比钢筋混凝土更容易燃烧且更不稳定。同时，在生产大强度产品时，往往木材的消耗量要远大于金属原料。然而，这些局限性正在被一些新的技术所解决，如交错纹理技术。\r树木在大自然中扮演着“碳汇”的角色，把大气中的碳储存起来。然而，增加木材的需求往往会影响生物多样性和森林的碳储存能力。请参阅土地和粮食行业对生物量的影响。\r对于钢材，大多数回收的金属目前是来自生产过程中的废料，而不是消费后的废料；生产废料通常易于分类，有助回收。然而，未来预计消费废料将进一步增加，因此消费废料分类将非常关键，同时混合金属回收等新技术也更加需要，如去除回收钢材中的铜。预计未来铝的回收率将下降，主要是因为废铝的可用性在未来预计很有限。而对于碳纤维材料则难以回收再利用。\r目前混凝土原料回收需要大量的能量，因此这项技术是缺乏经验的。然而，混凝土回收再利用在未来可能非常普遍，特别是当未来混凝土的型号更加标准化的时候。\r纸目前已经可以广泛的回收，在欧洲和北美地区大约60%的废纸被回收利用。在过去的十年中废纸回收率稳步增长，预计这一增长趋势随着欠发达国家废纸回收的增加仍将继续。\r如果您在这一条目中选择了一个较高水平的级，产品设计上的提高会转化为车辆效率的提高，所以您可能要考虑在“交通效率”条目中选择一个较高的级。"],

["For thousands of years, iron has been used to make products required for human use, such as tools. Today, steel, iron and aluminium are used to make many products, including cars, ships, electrical equipment, electrical equipment, buildings, domestic appliances and consumer packaging.\r\rIn the future, metal manufacturing processes could become more energy-efficient as technology advances, resulting in fewer emissions being released per tonne of metal manufactured. For example, currently the majority of steel is manufactured using traditional blast oxygen furnaces (71% in 2011) and electric arc furnaces (24% in 2011), but the steel industry is exploring several new technologies (e.g. Hisarna and electric arc Direct Reduced Iron), which could reduce the energy requirements of the process. These technologies can process different amounts of scrap; in the Global Calculator it is assumed that traditional blast furnaces can process 11% to 40% scrap, electric arc 100% scrap, HIsarna 0 to 30% scrap, and Electric arc Direct Reduced Iron 66% to 70%. See below for more detail on these technologies.\r\rEmissions per tonne of metal could also be reduced by using lower-carbon fuels to power the manufacturing processes. This could be achieved by (i) substituting the fuel used in the process for less carbon intensive fuel such as biomass, natural gas and hydrogen, (ii) using Combined Heat and Power (CHP) to provide the energy needs of the process, and (iii) capturing the carbon generated during the process to prevent its release to the atmosphere.","几千年来，人类使用铁制造各种人类所需要使用的产品，如各类工具。今天，钢、铁和铝制造了许多产品，包括汽车、船舶、电器、机电设备、建筑、家用电器和消费者的打包袋。\r\r在未来，随着技术的进步金属制造过程可能变得更加节能，从而减少每吨金属制造的排放。例如，目前钢材生产主要采用的是传统的氧气转炉法（2011年71%）和电弧炉法（2011年24%），但是钢铁行业正在探索一些新技术（如 HIsarna 和电弧直接还原铁法），这可能在制造过程中降低能源需求。不同的技术造成的废料总量也是不同的；在全球计算器中假设传统高炉产生11%到40%废料，电弧炉法产生100%废料，HIsarna 产生0%到30%废料，电弧直接还原铁法产生66%到70%废料。下文有这些技术的更多细节。\r\r采用低碳燃料进行金属制造也可以降低吨金属生产过程中的排放。这可以通过（i）在制造过程中采用低碳燃料如生物质燃料、天然气和氢气，（ii）使用热电联产技术（CHP）提供制造过程的能源需求，（iii）在制造过程中进行碳捕捉，以防止其释放到大气中。"],
["The emissions mentioned in this sector do not include those from electricity generation, to avoid double counting with the supply sector emissions.\r\rThe amount of biomass that is required as a fuel for iron, steel and aluminium production is accounted for in the calculations for the supply of biomass. In the Global Calculator, the maximum amount of biomass required for manufacturing is therefore determined, and then assessed against the biomass supply determined by other levers to determine the amount of fossil fuels that are substituted by biomass.\r\rIn order to have a consistent scenario, this lever (Iron, Steel and Aluminium) must be aligned with the Design, Materials and Recycling lever. This is because the chosen amount of recycling of steel defines the technologies used to manufacture steel products. \r\rAllwood and Cullen (2012) studied the potential for future innovative technologies to save energy and reduce emissions in future; they concluded that no currently developed methods offer a ‘step change’ in energy efficiency of manufacturing processes, and none were close to mass exploitation in 2012. Some of the potential innovative technologies are discussed below.\rToday, traditional blast furnaces are used to produce steel. Fuel (often coke), iron ore and limestone are supplied to the furnace, along with a blast of air at 900 – 1,300˚C, causing chemical reactions to produce ‘pig iron’. Pig iron pellets are then converted to primary steel using the Bessemer process, where oxygen is blown through the molten pig iron. More energy-efficient technologies for producing primary steel exist, and may become more prevalent in the future; for example, the HIsarna process can produce steel from molten pig iron directly from a specially-designed furnace, without having to convert the pig iron into pellets first; this simplifies the process and reduces the energy requirements.\r\rSecondary (recycled) steel is currently manufactured in electric arc furnaces, using electricity to generate the energy required to melt the used steel. Electric arc processes can also be used to make primary steel by feeding the electric arc furnace with direct reduced iron (DRI). Here iron ore is first converted to DRI in a gas-fuelled furnace at temperatures of 800 – 1,000˚C, before being converted to steel in conventional electric arc furnaces. As this process does not use coke, the emissions are lower than traditional steel manufacture.\r\rPrimary aluminium is manufactured by the electrolysis of alumina in molten cryolite (the Hall-Heroult process), and therefore the process emission intensity depends on the emission intensity of the electricity, and the amount of electricity required by the process. Industry has been investigating ways to reduce the electricity consumption of the Hall-Heroult process for several decades.\r\rAnother way to improve efficiency is by using combined heat and power (CHP) energy generation to power the process, where heat that is produced during electricity generation is used to meet process heat demands. Recently, CHP has been adapted more widely by industry.\r\rCarbon capture & storage technology could also help to reduce emissions. This is addressed by the lever “manufacturing CCS”.","这个模块提到的排放不包括发电领域，以免重复计算供应模块的排放量。\r\r计算生物质的供应量主要是从铁、钢和铝产品生产过程中所需的生物质燃料总量而来。因此在全球计算器中，制造业对生物质能的最大需求总量是确定的，然后确定其他条目中生物质能对化石燃料的替代总量来针对生物质能供应量进行评估。\r\r为了确保情景的一致性，这个条目（铁，钢和铝）必须与设计、材料和回收条目紧密联系。这是因为如果选定了钢的回收利用总量就相当于确定了钢在制造过程中所使用的技术。\r\rAllwood 和 Cullen（2012）主要研究未来能源节约以及减排方面潜在的技术创新；他们得出的结论是目前还没有一种“越阶”性的技术突破来提高制造过程中的能源效率，同时在2012年也没有技术大规模的开发。下面讨论一些潜在的技术创新。\r\r今天，我们使用传统的氧气转炉法生产钢铁。将燃料（通常为焦炭）、铁矿石、石灰石放入反应炉中，吹入空气达到900-1300℃，导致化学反应产生生铁。生铁丸通过贝塞麦过程（将氧气吹入融化的生铁中）转化为通用钢。在未来也许更节能的通用钢生产技术将会越来越普遍；例如，HIsarna过程由于其特别的设计原理可以从融化的生铁直接生产钢材，而不必把生铁转化为丸状；简化了炼制过程，减少了能源需求。\r\r重熔钢目前是采用电弧炉生产，使用电力产生能量使钢铁融化。电弧过程也可以制造通用钢，通过直接还原铁作为原料加入电弧炉中产生通用钢。这里的直接还原铁在电弧炉中转化为通用钢之前，要首先将铁矿石放入温度在800-1000℃的燃气炉中反应产生直接还原铁。在这个过程中不适用焦炭，排放量低于传统钢铁工业。\r\r原铝的制造采用电解氧化铝和冰晶石的熔融混合物制取（霍尔-埃鲁法），因此制铝过程的排放强度主要取决于发电的排放强度和制铝过程所需的电力消费总量。近几十年来制铝行业也一直致力于研究如何减少霍尔-埃鲁过程中的电耗。\r\r提高能源效率的另一种方式是采用热电联产技术提供制造过程中的能量，在发电过程中产生的热量用于满足工业制造用热需求。最近，热电联产技术已经在工业中更广泛的试用。\r\r碳捕集与封存技术也可以帮助减少排放。这是由“生产碳捕集与封存装置”条目来控制的。"],

["Cement is one of the main components of concrete, binding stones tightly together so that it can be used to build buildings. While cement had been known since Roman times (e.g. the Pantheon in Rome was build with it), concrete became enormously popular in the 20th century due to famous architects such as Le Corbusier who appreciated concrete as a relatively cheap and versatile material. \r\rCurrent annual global cement production is 2.8 Gt, which could produce 23 Gt of concrete; 40% of this cement is produced in China. Cement production is growing fast, and the Global Calculator can model cement production ranging from 3.3 to 8.7 Gt by 2050.\r\rCement production involves a number of reactions, with the principal reaction being the decomposition of limestone into lime and carbon dioxide. Half of the CO2 emissions associated with the production of cement are released in this reaction – another 40% are emitted from burning fuel to power the process. There are several ways to reduce cement energy inputs and emissions, including (i) substituting clinker for other materials, (ii) substituting the fuel used in the process for less carbon intensive fuel, and (iii) capturing the carbon generated during the process to prevent its release to the atmosphere.","水泥是混凝土的主要成分之一，它可以将石块紧紧粘合，以便于使用混凝土建造房屋。虽然水泥自罗马时代就已经为人们所知（例如罗马的万神殿就为水泥建造），但直到20世纪，混凝土由于被Le Corbusier等著名的建筑师认为是相当便宜并且万能的材料才得以成为非常热门的建筑材料。\r\r目前全球水泥年产量28亿吨，可以生产230亿吨的混凝土；这些水泥有40%产于中国。水泥产量增长迅速，同时，全球计算器模拟预测到2050年全球水泥年产量将在33 到87亿吨之间。\r\r水泥的生产包含着一系列的化学反应，其主要的反应是石灰石分解成石灰和二氧化碳。在水泥的生产过程中，有一半的二氧化碳排放是在这个反应中释放出来的-----另外40%是在燃料燃烧过程中排放出的。有几种方法可以减少水泥生产过程中的能量消耗和排放，（1）用其他材料替代水泥熟料，（2）将反应过程中的燃料替代为低碳燃料，（3）收集反应过程中的碳排放物从而避免其排放到大气中。"],
["In cement production, the most energy and emission intensive part of the process is the production of clinker. Therefore, to reduce energy inputs and emissions associated with cement, this clinker can be partially substituted by other materials (for example, ground granulated blast furnace slag or pulverised fly ash) that are by-products of other products or arise naturally. Substitution rates as high as 90% are possible for most applications. This ‘composed’ cement can be more resistant to compression, but it often takes longer to dry, implying higher storage costs.\r \rAnother way to reduce emissions is fuel substitution. In Europe it is common to burn waste material, such as old tyres and municipal solid waste, instead of fossil fuels; the presence of limestone in the process is known to clean the exhaust gas, allowing the use of such waste as fuel. \r\rToday, the best practice production has an energy need of 2.9 GJ per tonne of cement, whereas the theoretical minimum is 1.8 GJ/tonne. Thus, we cannot expect much technology improvement beyond current best practice. The global average lies today at 4.7 – 5.5 GJ/tonne, almost twice as high as best practice1. This is mainly due to small factories in China and India using old production technology; in particular, heat recovery systems are missing. The global energy use is expected to decrease rapidly as these older plants are being replaced in China.\r\rCarbon capture & storage technology could also help to reduce emissions. This is addressed by the lever “Carbon capture and storage (ind.)”.\r\rThe emissions mentioned in this sector do not include electricity, to avoid double counting with supply sector emissions.\r\rThe amount of biomass needed as fuel for the cement process is accounted for in the calculations for the supply of biomass. In the Global Calculator, the maximum amount of biomass required for cement production is therefore calculated, and then assessed against the biomass supply determined by other levers to determine the amount of fossil fuels that are substituted by biomass.","在水泥生产中，能耗和废气排放密度最大的过程是水泥熟料的生产。因此，为降低能耗和减少废气排放量，部分熟料可以用其他工业生产的副产品或自然原材料替代（例如粒状高炉矿渣或者粉煤灰）。在大多数生产应用中熟料的替代率可以超过90%。这种合成的水泥可以更加抗压缩，不过它通常需要更长时间才能变干，这意味着需要更高的保管成本。\r\r另一种减少废气排放的方法是燃料的替代。在欧洲，水泥制造厂通常燃烧诸如废旧轮胎和城市固体废物等替代化石燃料；石灰石在这个过程中可以净化废气，使得这些废料能够作为燃料使用。\r\r目前，最优的生产方式每吨水泥的能源需求为29 亿焦耳，然而理论上最小值是每吨18亿焦耳。因此，我们无法预测未来需要多少技术改进才会比目前的最佳方式要好。现在全球平均水平是在每吨47~55亿焦耳之间，几乎是最优方式能源需求的两倍。这主要是因为中国和印度的小型水泥生产厂使用的还是老式的生产技术，尤其是因为老式的生产技术中没有热量回收系统。目前由于中国这些小工厂正在被逐步取代，将有望使全球能源消费量迅速减少。\r\r碳捕集与封存技术将有助于减少废气的排放。这会在“碳捕集与封存”条目中写到。在这个模块中提到的排放不包括电力领域，以免重复计算供应模块的排放量。\r\r水泥生产过程中使用的生物质能源量被计入生物质能源供应总量中。在全球计算器中，首先计算水泥生产过程中所需的最大生物质量，然后确定其他条目中生物质能对化石燃料的替代总量来针对生物质能供应量进行评估。"],

Oil is a particularly versatile fuel being used for transport (cars, planes etc.) and electricity generation, as well as for manufacturing products like plastic. The question is therefore if we want to burn oil or use it for other purposes in the future. The main challenges might be the electrification of transport and replacing aviation fuel with bio fuels.","在火力发电厂中，化石（生物质）燃料通过蒸汽涡轮燃烧和转换为电能。虽然化石燃料发电需要一系列连续性的运作，但化石燃料发电厂的启动和关闭速度要远高于核电站，这使它成为更适合可再生能源的调峰电源。在2011年，化石燃料发电量占据了全球电力供应市场的71%。化石燃料是由生活在数亿年前的厌氧生物（史前植物和动物）分解而形成的。石油就是一种被非常广泛使用的化石燃料，可用于运输工具(汽车、飞机等)、发电、以及用于制造工业产品，如塑料。问题是如果我们未来仍然想使用石油作为燃料或用于其它用途，那么主要的挑战可能在于电气化交通领域以及生物质燃料对航空燃料的替代。"],
["In terms of climate impact, the dirtiest fuels are: firstly coal, secondly oil, and thirdly natural gas. For example, today, lignite (brown coal) is most carbon-intensive, emitting about 100,000 grams of CO2 per Gigajoule (g/GJ) followed by hard coal with 95,000 g/GJ. Oil has around 75,000 g/GJ. The fossil fuel with the lowest climate change impact is natural gas with 56,000 g/GJ. Currently electricity generation from coal is the cheapest because it is about four times more abundant than oil or natural gas. However in the future, carbon taxation and other regulatory means are expected to increase the costs for coal and favour natural gas. The average lifetime of fossil fuel power plants is around 30-50 years. All of them need several decades to recover the costs of their initial investment, so this might hinder the change towards natural gas. Given the long lifespan of thermal power plants, another solution could be the usage of biomass as fuel. If the user selects a high output of solid biomass, the model will automatically allocate some of this to electricity generation if “coal” is selected. The user can generate a high output of solid biomass by: reducing land required for food by reducing food demand or boosting food yields; adjusting the “surplus land (forest and bioenergy)” lever such that surplus land is used for bioenergy; setting “bioenergy yields” high; and setting “solid or liquid” to solid.","在对气候的影响方面，污染最大的燃料首先是煤，其次是石油、第三是天然气。例如，现在褐煤是碳排放强度最高的燃料，每十亿焦耳排放100,000克二氧化碳；其次是无烟煤，每十亿焦耳排放95,000克二氧化碳。石油大概是每十亿焦耳75,000克。对气候变化影响最小的化石燃料是天然气，大约每十亿焦耳排放56,000克二氧化碳。目前用煤做燃料发电是最便宜的，因为煤的产量大约是石油或天然气的四倍。然而，未来由于碳排放税和其他监管手段的实施，预计燃烧煤炭成本会增加而天然气则更受青睐。然而，化石燃料发电厂的平均使用寿命大约是30 - 50年。所有化石燃料发电厂需要几十年才能收回初期投资成本，所以这或许会阻碍天然气的替代。考虑到火力发电厂的长使用寿命，另一种办法就是使用生物质能源作为燃料。另一个解决方案是用生物质作为燃料发电。如果用户选择了一个较高的固体生物质能源产量，且选择了“煤炭”，模型会自动给发电行业分配一定比例的生物质燃料。用户控制固体生物质能源产量可以通过：减少食物需求量或提高粮食产量以减少种植粮食所需的土地面积；调节“剩余土地(森林和生物能源)”条目，可以将多余的土地用于生物能源；将“生物能源产量”选项设置为高产值，并将“固体或液体”选项设置为固体。"],

["In 2011, fossil fuels were the world’s main source of energy, with 82% of global primary energy coming from fossil fuels. Improving fossil fuel power plant efficiencies could therefore be a powerful lever to decrease carbon dioxide emissions. As described below, efficient technologies are already available, but long power plant lifetimes of around 50 years make market adaptation relatively slow. Further technological improvements may reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the cost for highly efficient technologies. Increases in carbon taxation could also speed up the transition to more efficient power plant technologies. While Japan and South Korea mainly employ efficient coal power technologies (more than 70% of all coal power plants) most other major industrial nations have relatively inefficient power plants (less than 40% of all coal power plants) due to their low initial investment costs and the high lifespans. This shows the large potential for efficiency improvement.","在2011年,化石能源是世界主要的能源,全球82%的一次能源来自化石燃料。提高化石燃料机组效率是减少二氧化碳排放强有力的方式。如下所述,高效的技术已经可以使用，但由于电厂约50年的使用寿命使市场的适应性相对较慢。进一步的技术进步可以减少二氧化碳的排放量并降低高效技术的成本。碳排放税的增加将会加速发电机组向更高效技术发展的进程。当日本和韩国主要采用高效燃煤发电技术的时候(超过70%的燃煤发电厂)，大多数其他主要工业国家由于较低的初期投资和较高的预期使用寿命，仍还在使用相对低效的发电机组(少于40%的燃煤发电厂)。这表明在发电机组的效率提升上还有巨大的潜力。"],
["It is worth considering the three types of power plant separately – gaseous (for natural gas), liquid (oil) and solid (coal or possibly biomass) fuel. Gaseous fuel: There are two main types of gas-fired power plants. The open-cycle gas turbine (OCGT) consists of a single compressor/gas turbine being connected to an electricity generator. About two-third of the generated energy is used to compress air for the combustion process. The second technology is combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT) that basically consist of the same components as an OCGT. However, the turbine exhaust is re-used to generate energy with a heat recovery steam engine.\r\rThe thermal efficiency of OCGT lies currently between 35 – 42% and is expected to increase up to 45% by 2020. The thermal efficiency of CCGT lies currently between 52 – 60% and is expected to increase up to 64% by 2020. While the initial investment cost is slightly higher for CCGT, the annual operation and maintenance costs are much lower ($73/kWh compared to $210/MWh for OCGT) today. Building CCGT is therefore more beneficial in the long run in terms of costs and carbon dioxide emissions.\r\rLiquid fuel: The technological concepts for oil fired power plants are very similar to natural gas fired power plants. The model considers two types of plants: low efficiency power plants (<50% efficiency) and high efficiency power plants (>50% efficiency). Similar to gaseous fuel, higher efficiencies can be achieved when re-using the exhaust for power generation.\r\rSolid fuel: There are three main technologies for power generation from coal. In all three, coal is pulverised into fine powder, and the larger surface area allows for a more efficient combustion process. The pressure and temperature in the combustion chamber are the main difference between subcritical, supercritical and ultra-supercritical power plants.\rThe thermal efficiency of coal fired power plants increases with temperature and pressure, leading to efficiency levels of around 38% for subcritical, 43% for supercritical and 45% for ultra-supercritical power plants. The initial investment costs for super critical power plants are about 10 – 20% higher than for subcritical ones and about 10% lower than for ultra-supercritical ones.\r\rIf the user selects a pathway with high solid biomass, the model will automatically allocate some biomass to be used in the solid fuel power plants.  For more detail on this, see the “solid / liquid / gas” lever description.","有三种类型的发电机组值得考虑，分别是——使用气体燃料(比如天然气)、使用液体燃料(石油油)和使用固体燃料(煤炭或生物质)。使用气体燃料：主要有两种类型的燃气装置。一种是使用开式循环燃气轮机(OCGT)，是由单一的压缩机/燃气轮机连接到一个发电机构成。在燃烧过程中，这种燃气轮机产生的大约三分之二的能量被用作压缩气体。第二种技术是与OCGT有着相同组件的联合循环燃气轮机(CCGT)。但是这种轮机排出的废气可以通过一个热回收蒸汽引擎被回收再利用。\r\r开式循环燃气轮机(OCGT)的热效率目前在35-42%之间, 到2020年预计将增加到45%。联合循环燃气轮机(CCGT)热效率目前在52-60%之间,到2020年预计将增加到64%。虽然CCGT的初始投资成本比OCGT略高,但CCGT的年操作费和维护成本要比OCGT低许多(与OCGT的210美元/兆瓦时相比，CCGT 是73美元/千瓦时)。因此，建造联合循环燃气轮机更有利于长远的成本节约和二氧化碳排放量控制。\r\r液体燃料:石油发电机组的技术理念与天然气发电很相似。模型考虑了两种类型的发电机组: 一种是低效率发电机组(效率< 50%)，一种是高效发电机组(效率> 50%)。类似于气体燃料,当排放的废气被回收再用于发电时，高效的发电技术也是可以实现的。\r\r固体燃料：煤炭发电的技术主要有三种。在这三种技术中，煤块都会被研磨成微粒，因为更大的表面积会使燃烧过程的效率更高。燃烧室的压强和温度是次临界、超临界和超超临界发电机组的主要区别。\r\r燃煤机组的热效率随温度和压力的变化而提高，次临界机组的效率水平在38%左右，超临界机组是43%，超超临界机组是45%。超临界机组的初始投资成本比次临界机组高约10-20%，比超超临界机组低约10%。\r\r如果用户选择一个高固体生物质能源路径，模型会自动分配一些固体生物质能源用于固体燃料的发电机组。更多细节,请参阅“固体/液体/气体”条目的描述。"],

In 2011 there were 435 operating nuclear reactors totalling 369 GW of capacity, producing around 13% of the world’s electricity.

["Nuclear has some benefits compared to many other low-carbon electricity sources. It can produce a reliable supply of power, unlike some renewables such as wind and solar which are intermittent. Once built, a reactor has a lifespan of around 40 years and perhaps longer. If power plants are located close to buildings with heat demand, then the waste heat produced in the generating process can be used in district heating systems rather than being released into the atmosphere. This reduces the need for high-carbon sources of heat like gas. \r\rHowever, nuclear power has disadvantages too. Nuclear accidents, though rare, can have serious and long-term consequences. The safe disposal and storage of the radioactive waste produced by nuclear processes is also a serious challenge, as some of the substances have a half-life of many thousand – and even millions – of years. These concerns mean that some countries and organisations do not support the use of this technology.  Even in countries that support the use of nuclear power, the planning process can be long and difficult, as local residents may object to having a power plant near their homes. The meltdown of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011 has increased safety concerns, and led to more countries closing nuclear power plants before their natural lifespan has come to an end.\r\rWhen choosing levels 3 or 4, you should consider that building this amount of nuclear power is likely to result in many planning challenges and may be difficult in terms of public acceptability.","核电相比于其他低碳电力来源具有一些好处。它能产生可靠而稳定的电力，不像一些间歇性的可再生能源如风能和太阳能。而且，一旦反应堆建成寿命约为40年，或许更长时间。如果核电厂靠近热力需求建筑群，其发电过程中的废热便可直接用于区域供热系统，而不用释放到大气中。这也减少了由高碳能源如天然气来供热。\r\r然而，核电也有一些缺点。如核事故，虽然很罕见，可是有非常严重的而且长期的后果。而且，核电发电过程中产生的核废料和其中的放射性物质的安全处理和储存也是一个严重的挑战，一些物质的半衰期为数千年，甚至数百万年。这些问题意味着一些国家和组织不支持这项技术的使用。甚至一些支持使用核电的国家，也由于人民很可能会反对核电站建设在居住附近，而使得计划过程很长，很困难。2011年日本福岛第一核电站的三个反应堆崩溃引发了大家对核电安全的忧虑，并且导致更多的国家在其核电站寿命之前，提前关闭了该国诸多核电站。\r\r当您选择3或者4级的时候，您应该考虑建设如此庞大的核电总量可能导致许多计划上的挑战和公共接受性的困难。"],

["Wind energy is a renewable source of energy that extracts the energy stored in moving air. Turbines generating electric energy from wind are installed either onshore or offshore, sometimes on farmland, and are generally connected to the power transmission network. As it is not always windy, about 15 – 50 % of the capacity is actually used at any given time, and this is very dependent on where a turbine is located.  Wind power has been used for centuries to mill flour or pump water from land below sea level. In 2011, there were close to 200,000 operating wind turbines, totalling 238 GW of capacity and producing around 3% of the world’s electricity. In 2012, China (at that time the country with the highest fraction of the world’s wind power capacity) produced more electric energy from wind than from nuclear. In 2013, the country with the highest proportion of wind power was Denmark with 33% of its energy mix.\r\rAlthough affected by the financial crisis, build rates were still growing in the last few years. The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) forecasts a cumulative installed capacity of 750 GW by 2020.The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects that 80% of the growth in wind power until 2035 will be onshore. The reason for this is that despite higher capacity utilisation rates, offshore wind farms are more expensive than onshore ones because of higher installation costs.","风能是一种从空气流动中提取能量的可再生能源。能够进行风力发电的涡轮机被安置于陆上、海上，有时也可安装于农田上，它们通常与输电网络相连接。由于并非每天都为有风天气，在任何给定的时间，实际使用电量只占容量的15-50%左右，且很大程度上取决于涡轮机所处的位置。多个世纪以来，风能一直被用于碾磨面粉，或是从低于海平面的土地下泵水。2011 年，运行中的风力涡轮机接近 200,000，产能共计238千兆瓦，发电量占全球总发电量的比重约为 3%。2012 年，中国（当时世界上风力发电容量最高的国家） 风能发电总量高于核能发电总量。2013年，风力发电比例最高的国家为丹麦，风力发电占能源结构的比重达33%。\r\r尽管受金融危机影响，过去几年建造速率一直保持增长。全球风能理事会（GWEC） 预测，到2020年，累计装机容量将达750千兆瓦。国际能源署（IEA）预计，2035年之前，80%的风力发电增长都为陆上风。其原因为，尽管海上风电场产能利用率更高，但由于安装成本较高，海上风电场造价比陆上风电场更为昂贵。"],
["A key advantage of wind power is its potential to save carbon emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) assessed the emissions to be 11-12 g of carbon dioxide equivalent per kWh, which mainly arises from the production of the wind turbine. This is considerably lower than for other low carbon power sources such as solar or geothermal energy. In contrast to nuclear energy, wind energy does not produce any toxic waste that has to be stored safely for thousands of years.\r\rHowever, wind energy has also several disadvantages. Wind farms cover large areas of land that could otherwise be used differently e.g. for natural forest or housing. Ecological damage may be caused if bird migration is hindered. Since wind blows very inconsistently, the energy generation of wind turbines varies significantly. Currently, gas and coal power plants have to balance out this variation. However, in future, intelligent grids and storage techniques might be able to manage this in a smart way, and the battery capacity of electric vehicles might be used to store wind energy (for example, during night-time when the energy demand is low). Additionally, the aesthetic perception, noise pollution and shading effects can be important for people living close to wind turbines. Therefore, wind farms can usually not be built close to areas with high population densities. In contrast, wind farms and agriculture sharing the same area might be a promising combination for efficient land use.\r\rWhen choosing levels 3 or 4, land use for wind power will be significant and adaptations may be needed to the electricity supply system. The introduction of electric cars and the development of high performing storage systems might help to achieve the transition to more wind energy.","风力发电的一个关键优势是其减少碳排放的潜力。政府间气候变化专门委员会（IPCC）评估其排放量为每千瓦时11-12克二氧化碳当量，主要由风力涡轮机产生。这一数据远低于其他低碳能源，如太阳能、地热能。相对于核能、 风能不会产生任何需要安全存储数千年的有毒废料。\r\r然而，风能也有若干缺点。风电场占地面积较大，这些土地本可另作他用，如天然森林或住房。如果阻碍鸟类迁徙，可能会造成生态破坏。由于风速不稳定，风力涡轮机的能源生产存在显著差异。目前，不得不借助天然气和煤电厂抵消这一差异。然而，在将来，智能电网和存储技术也许能用巧妙的方式解决这一问题，电动汽车的电池容量可能被用于存储风能（例如，在能源需求较低的夜间）。此外，审美感知、噪音污染和遮蔽效应对于生活在风力涡轮机附近的居民而言同样重要。因此，风力发电场通常不能建立在人口密度较高的区域附近。相反，若风电场和农业共用同一区域，这一组合有望实现土地的高效利用。\r\r当选择3级或4级时，大量土地将被用于风力发电，电力供应系统可能需要进行适当调整。电动汽车的引入和高性能存储系统的发展也许有助于实现向风能的过渡。"],

The reservoir of the Three-Gorges-Dam in China, for instance, covers an area of 1,045 km2 which is about half the size of Luxembourg. Several villages had to be displaced and the ecosystem was drastically affected. This environmental impact raises strong public and political objections against hydroelectricity in various countries.

The worldwide potential of wave energy was estimated to be 2,000 GW. The highest potential regions include the Pacific coastlines of North and South America, Australia and New Zealand and the Atlantic seaboard of Western Europe. The main competitor for wave power is offshore wind power.\r\rThe principle of tidal power was already used by tide mills in England and France in the 17th century, and the first large-scale tidal power plant was opened in France in 1966. While 3,000 GW or more of tidal energy is estimated to be globally available, less than 3% of this can be realistically used for power generation because of geological inaccessibility.

["Marine power has huge potential but this is limited by its high initial investment costs. But tidal power plants also have several advantages compared to other low carbon technologies.

["Solar energy is a type of renewable energy which converts energy from sunlight into electricity. Every year, 1.5 × 1018 kWh of solar power reaches the earth’s surface, which is more than 10,000 times the current global energy demand.\r\rThere are different technologies to harvest solar energy. The most popular is photovoltaics (PV) from crystalline silicon with efficiencies of around 16% (currently about 80 to 95 % of the PV market). The rest of the PV market is shared between amorphous Silicon, Cadmium-Telluride (CaTe) and Copper-Indium-Gallium-Diselenide (CIGS). In 2011, the global capacity of PV was 70 GW, of which 80% was installed in just a few countries such as Germany, Spain and Japan. \r\rAnother approach is Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). Mirrors concentrate light on an absorbing device which heats up a thermal fluid that drives a conventional steam turbine. Typical CSP plants have a capacity of 0.01 – 0.08 GW and an efficiency of 14 to 16%. As the sun is not always shining and only direct sunlight is correctly concentrated by the mirrors, about 25 to 30% of the capacity is used for electricity generation depending on the location. In 2011, a capacity of 1.6 GW was operating, mainly in Spain and the United States.","太阳能是一种将太阳光中的能量转化为电能的可再生能源。每年有1.5×1018千瓦时的太阳能抵达地球表面，比当前全球能源需求的10,000 倍还多。\r\r获取太阳能的技术种类繁多。最流行的是的晶体硅光伏（PV）电池，转换率约为16%（占当前光伏市场的比重达80至95%左右）。其余的光伏市场则被非晶硅、 碲化镉（CaTe）、碲化镉和铜铟镓硒（CIGS）所占据。2011年，全球太阳能光伏发电容量能为70千兆瓦，但 80%都集中在德国、西班牙、日本等少数国家。\r\r另一种方法是聚光太阳能发电（CSP）。反射镜将太阳光聚集在吸热装置上加热热流体，驱动传统汽轮机运转。典型的聚光太阳能发电厂容量为1到8万千瓦，转换率为14-16%。由于不能保证总是晴朗天气，且反射镜只能将直射的太阳光聚集起来，因此根据位置的不同，约25-30%的容量被用于发电。2011 年，发电容量为160万千瓦，主要集中在西班牙和美国。"],
["Solar PV is a strongly growing technology, which capacity increases of around 40% per year in the last couple of years. In recent years this was mainly due to financial support from governments (e.g. China, India, Germany and Spain). The price for crystalline silicon solar cells is continuously falling, reaching a level below $0.40 per Watt peak in 2014 according to Bloomberg. This is cheap enough to achieve cost parity in countries with high solar irradiation such as Italy and Spain. It is therefore likely that solar PV will continue to grow fast in the future, with prices for solar PV likely to decrease even further.\r\rLike all technologies, PV is not completely carbon neutral, as the purification process of silicon in particular is very energy intensive. After around 3 years of operation, the initial carbon emissions are saved, and lifetimes easily exceed 20 years. Other technologies, such as organic PV and some thin film technologies are less carbon intensive. It is possible that one of those technologies might overtake silicon, with increasing governmental spending in solar R&D.\r\rThe cost for concentrated solar power (CSP) is currently higher than for solar PV. However an advantage of CSP is that the generated energy can be stored in a molten salt storage system over a period of several hours which may enable it to serve peak loads on the same day.\r\rElectricity generated from CSP could also be used elsewhere. The goal of the Desertec consortium, for instance, was to harvest solar power in North Africa and transfer it with an efficient grid to Europe. A key concern of this type of projects is the very high investment cost. Another major challenge for CSP is that it requires a lot of water, in what are usually very dry areas. Additionally, electricity transport with the current grid technology would suffer from considerable energy loss over such a long distance and therefore further effort in R&D is needed. Besides technical, financial and regulatory drawbacks, the safety and security of solar installations is becoming a big challenge in developing countries. As remote installations may lack proper security arrangements, there may be problems of theft and asset destruction which may deter new investors. \r\rTo choose levels 3 or 4, you would need to believe that solar power will have a considerable share in the energy mix of 2050. This would probably require technology improvements and cost reductions, along with supportive policy.","太阳能光伏发电技术正处于蓬勃发展之中，过去几年内，其容量每年增长接近40%。这主要得益于今年来政府（如中国、印度、德国和西班牙）的财政支持。晶体硅太阳能电池的价格不断下降，彭博社的数据显示，其价格在2014年跌破每瓦特0.40美元。这一价格便宜到使太阳辐射高的国家，如意大利和西班牙等实现成本平价。因此，太阳能光伏发电可能会在未来迅猛发展，而价格则有可能进一步下降。\r\r同所有的技术一样，光伏并非完全碳平衡，因为硅提纯过程尤其耗能。经过近 3 年的运营，初始碳排放量得以减少，寿命很容易超过20年。其他技术，如有机光伏和一些薄膜技术耗能相对较小。随着政府在太阳能研发领域投资的增加，这些技术很可能有朝一日将硅取而代之。\r\r当前聚光太阳能发电 （CSP）的成本比太阳能光伏发电要高。然而，聚光太阳能发电的一个优势是生成的能量可以在熔盐储能系统中存储几个小时，用于当天的峰值负荷期。\r\r聚光太阳能发电也可以应用于其他领域。例如，沙漠科技联盟（Desertec consortium）的目标是将在北非地区获取的太阳能通过高效电网输送到欧洲。这种项目的一个关键问题是投资成本极高。聚光太阳能发电的另一个主要挑战是耗水量大，通常是在严重干旱地区。此外，使用现有电网技术进行如此长距离的电力运输,能量损失相当大，因此需要在研发领域进行进一步的发展完善。除技术、 资金和监管缺陷之外，在发展中国家，太阳能装置的安全和保障已经成为一个巨大的挑战。由于装置位置偏僻，可能缺乏适当的安全设置，因此可能出现的盗窃和设备破坏问题也许会使新的投资者举步不前。\r\r若选择3级或4级，你需要相信太阳能发电将在 2050 年的能源结构中占有相当大的份额。这可能需要技术的改进、成本的降低以及政策的支持。"],

["Geothermal energy is thermal energy that originates mainly from the radioactive decay of minerals. This energy can either be used directly for heating or electricity generation. Geothermal energy is considered as a renewable source of energy because the energy extracted from the earth is negligible compared to the amount of energy stored in the core.\r\rIn 2012, the global capacity for geothermal electricity generation was 11.6 GW, and the capacity of directly used geothermal heat was about 28 GW. Around 24 counties used geothermal electricity and 70 countries used geothermal heat. Geothermal power plants have traditionally been built on the edges of tectonic plates, since the temperatures close to the surface are higher. The maximum potential lies in countries located on the so-called “Ring of Fire”, a zone of major seismic activity including volcanoes and earthquakes in the basin of the Pacific Ocean. This is why the United States, the Philippines and Indonesia are the countries with the highest geothermal capacity in 2011.\r\rAn optimistic outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that geothermal electricity could have 3.5% of the world’s energy generation.","地热能属于热能，主要源自矿物的放射性衰变。这一能量可直接用于供热或发电。地热能被视为可再生能源，因为与存储在地核中巨大的能量相比，从地球中提取的能量小到可以忽略不计。\r\r2012年，全球地热发电总容量为1160万千瓦，直接用于地热供暖的容量达2800万千瓦。约有24 个国家使用地热发电， 70多个国家使用地热供暖。地热发电厂通常健在地壳构造板块边缘之上，原因是其近表层温度更高。潜在地热资源最丰富的区域是处在所谓“火环”上的国家，这一区域位于太平洋盆地，地震活动频繁，经常发生火山爆发和地震。这解释了为什么美国、 菲律宾和印尼在2011年成为地热容量最高的国家。\r\r国际能源署（IEA）的一份报告乐观预测，地热发电有望占据全球能源发电的3.5%。"],
["Geothermal has several benefits compared to other energy sources. In particular the minimal freshwater and land requirements are strong advantages. A geothermal plant uses on average an area of 3.5 km2 per GW, which is about 90% less than for coal and 70% less than for wind farms. In terms of fresh water, geothermal uses 20 litres per MWh compared to more than 1,000 litres per MWh that are usually needed for coal electricity generation.\r\rIn contrast, geothermal energy also has disadvantages. Although being a renewable source of energy, power generation does need to be monitored as there is evidence for local depletion – ground and groundwater temperatures can be reduced, resulting in a reduction of power plant efficiency. Also during the process of thermal electricity generation, greenhouse gases are dissolved from the ground which are subsequently released in the atmosphere - this effect is comparably small so that carbon dioxide equivalent emissions over the lifespan of a geothermal power plant is still lower than for solar cells but higher than for wind, hydro and nuclear power (IPCC). Another issue might be the limited amount of well-suited sites with optimal power generation efficiencies on edges of tectonic plates. If geothermal is promoted further in the future, lower plant efficiencies have to be accepted.\r\rTo choose levels 3 or 4, you would need to believe that geothermal power plants will also be built at locations with lower efficiencies, which would involve higher economic costs.","同其他能源相比，地热有若干优点。极小的淡水和土地需求是其突出的优点。一家地热发电厂的平均使用面积为每千兆瓦3.5平方公里，比煤电厂少90%，比风力发电厂少70%。就淡水而言，地热每兆瓦时使用20升淡水，而燃煤发电每兆瓦时通常需要超过1000升淡水。\r\r相反，地热能也有缺点。尽管属于可再生能源，但无需监测其发电，因为局部资源枯竭的征兆-地面和地下水温度降低将造成发电厂效率下降。此外，在地热发电过程中，温室气体从地面渗出，最终释放到大气中— —这一影响相对较小，因此地热发电厂在其寿命期内排放的二氧化碳当量仍然低于太阳能电池，但高于风能、水电和核能（ IPCC）。另一个问题可能是，在地壳构造板块边缘上能够实现最优发电效率的合适区域数量极少。如果地热在未来得到进一步的发展，那么就必须接受相对较低的工厂效率。\r\r若选择3级或4级，需要相信地热发电厂也将建在效率较低的位置，而经济成本也会更高。"],

["This lever controls the global average quantity of calories consumed per person each day","本条目控制全球人均日千卡路里消耗量"],
["In 2011, the global average calorie consumption was 2,180 kcal per person per day. This value represents the effective calorie intake by person and excludes losses along the supply chain (currently approximately 24% of food energy content). This average value is greater than the recommended consumption by the World Health Organisation of 2,100 kcal per person per day. However, food consumption is not distributed evenly throughout the world, and in some regions extremes exist, such as undernourishment and obesity. For example, approximately 805 million people in the world do not currently have enough food to lead a healthy, active life. On the other hand, in 2010, more than 1.4 billion adults were overweight (BMI > 25) of which 500 million were obese (BMI > 30).\r\rPeople living in developed countries generally consume more calories than in developing countries. For example, in 2011 people in the USA and the EU consumed on average 2,729 and 2,520 kcal per person per day respectively, whilst in Bangladesh people consumed on average 1,823 kcal per person per day. It has therefore been projected that food consumption will increase in the future, as people in developing countries move to higher-calorie diets. For example, Alexandratos and Bruinsma (2012) projected that food consumption will increase by 11% between 2007 and 2050. However, if food consumption could be distributed more evenly, people could move to healthier diets with less obesity and undernourishment, without significantly increasing total calorie intake.","2011年，全球人均日千卡路里消耗量达2180千卡。这一数值代表人体摄入的有效千卡路里，不包括供应链中的千卡路里损耗(目前约占食物所含能量的24%)。这一平均值高于世界卫生组织提出的人均每日消耗2100千卡路里的标准。然而世界范围内，食品消费量并不平衡，在一些地区存在极端现象，如营养不良和超重。例如，世界上有8亿500万人口缺少食物。但在2010年，超过14亿成年人体重超标（身体质量指数>25），其中5亿人口肥胖（身体质量指数>30）。\r\r总的来说，与发展中国家相比，发达国家人口消耗千卡路里更多。例如，2011年，美国与欧盟国家的人均日千卡路里消耗量分别为2729千卡和2520千卡，而孟加拉国人均日千卡路里消耗量为1823千卡。经预测，未来发展中国家会更多选择高热量食物，食品消费量将有所提高。例如，据预测，2007至2050年间，食品消费的分布会更加平均，人们会倾向于选择健康饮食，超重和和营养不良的现象会有所减少，但总体千卡路里摄入量会有明显增长。"],
["The land and emissions impact of diet is affected by the type of food consumed as well as the total calories.

Increased demand for food could be met either through increases in yields or an expansion of agricultural land. Increases in the production of food from each unit of existing agricultural land (the yield) may be able to increase food supplies enough to supply the additional food required for 8.3 to 10.9 billion people by 2050 without having to convert native ecosystems to agricultural land.\r\rHowever, agricultural land expansion could put pressure on existing forests if this yield increase doesn’t take place. Conversion of forest land to crop land or pasture can release greenhouse gas emissions (carbon stored on the land is oxidised to CO2).

["This lever controls the global average proportion of meat calories consumed that is from ruminant animals (cows and other bovines, sheep and goats).

["Ruminants include cows and other bovines, sheep and goats. These animals have four-chambered stomachs that allow them to digest fibrous plant-based food (such as grass) efficiently and, on average, are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions per unit of meat produced than non-ruminants. Non-ruminants are also known as monogastric animals and include chicken and pigs; these animals have simple, single-chambered stomachs and are therefore less efficient than ruminants at extracting energy from fibrous plant-based food.\r\rThe share of ruminant meat in the average global diet has reduced steadily since the 1970s (although owing to increasing meat consumption, absolute production has increased), whereas the share of non-ruminant meat (in particular poultry) has been increasing. Currently, meat from non-ruminants constitutes the dominant share of meat consumed globally. The share of ruminant meat varies significantly between different countries. For example, in Brazil 38% of all meat energy consumed is from ruminant animals, whereas in China only 9% is from ruminants.\r\rThe UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012) forecast that between 2005/7 and 2050, total demand for all meat types will increase, with poultry demand increasing by 1.8% per year, pork demand by 0.8% per year, beef demand by 1.2% per year and sheep and goat demand by 1.5% per year.

["The production of ruminant meat is, on average, associated with significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions than the production of non-ruminant meat per unit of energy output. One of the reasons for this is that ruminants produce methane as a by-product of their digestion process, which is a greenhouse gas with approximately 29 times the global warming potential of CO2. Ruminant animals are also generally less land efficient than non-ruminants. For example, in 2011 an area the size of a football pitch would typically yield approximately 25,000 kcal per year of pasture fed beef, 380,000 kcal per year of intensively managed beef or 1,450,000 kcal per year of poultry.\r\rA shift to lower levels of ruminant meat consumption could therefore help to reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of our diets, as well as free up land to make way for other uses, such as growing bioenergy crops and establishing new forests.\r\rOn the other hand, there is also the possibility to increase the proportion of ruminants raised in feed-lot systems using the “Livestock (grains/residues fed)” lever, as well as the numbers of ruminants per hectare in grazing systems (i.e., animal density) by using the “Livestock (pasture fed)” lever, which can reduce the need for additional pasture and the emissions per unit of meat produced.","总体来说，就每单位能量产出而言，反刍动物相较于非反刍动物会产生更多温室气体。其中一个原因是因为反刍动物消化过程中会产生甲烷，而甲烷引起全球变暖的机率是CO2的约29倍。反刍动物的土地利用率通常也不及非反刍动物。例如，2011年，一个足球场大小的草场每年一般可以产出25000千千卡的牛肉、380000千千卡集约化生产的牛肉或1450000千千卡的家禽。因此，减少反刍动物肉类的消费量就能有助于减少饮食中的温室气体痕迹，也能使更多土地挪作他用，如种植生物能作物和植树造林。 \r\r另一方面，“家畜（以谷物和残渣为饲料）”条目可能会使更多反刍动物饲养在围栏育肥地系统中，而“家畜（以草为饲料）”条目则有可能使草场系统中每公顷反刍动物的数量增加（即动物密度），这就能减少额外的草场需求，降低每单位肉类产量的温室气体排放量。"],

["Between 1961 and 2007 global average crop yields (the amount of food produced per area of land) increased by 1.7% per year, owing to increased mechanisation, increased fertilisation and irrigation use, and improved crop varieties. Crop yields are predicted to continue to rise up to 2050, albeit at a lower rate; the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) project that between 2005/7 and 2050, global average cereal yields will increase by 0.8% per year, corresponding to a total increase in global average yield between 2011 and 2050 of 36%.  \r\rAn increase in crop yields means that less land will be needed to produce the same amount of food. As the world’s food needs are expected to increase, more land will be needed for food crops which may lead to deforestation. Improving crop yields can reduce this pressure on forests and other natural habitats.","1961年到2007年间，由于机械化水平提高，肥料及灌溉投入增加，作物种类更加丰富，因而全球作物平均产量（单位土地面积粮食产量）每年增长了1.7%。尽管增长率将会降低，但作物产量截止到2050年仍会持续增长；联合国粮农组织（FAO）预计，从2005/7年到2050年间，全球谷物平均产量每年将增长0.8%，与2011-2050年间全球平均产量增幅36%相一致。 \r\r作物产量的增加意味着生产等量粮食所需的土地面积减少了。由于全球粮食需求将会增大，因而更多的土地会用于粮食生产，这可能会导致森林面积的减少。粮食产量的增加将减缓对森林和其他自然栖息地造成的压力。"],
["Many experts consider that there is significant potential for crop yields to continue to increase to 2050, particularly in developing countries where the difference between actual yields and potential yields based on agro-ecological parameters is large. There are several ways to increase crop yields, including improving crop varieties to increase their (i) photosynthetic efficiencies, (ii) tolerance to pests, diseases, saline conditions and drought, and (iii) efficiencies of water and nutrient use.  This can involve traditional plant breeding methods (annual selection of higher yielding seeds, and the development of new varieties), marker assisted breeding and/or genetic modification (GM: the insertion of specific genes into the genes of a target plant, often from a separate species).\r\rTraditional plant breeding methods have been adopted for centuries, whilst GM methods have only been developed over the past few decades. However, GM crops are already planted on 170 million hectares (WRI, 2013), representing 12% of total cropland area in 2011; the majority (90%) of GM crops are currently grown in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina and India. The potential implications of GM crops are currently heavily debated. Issues of contention include the potential ecosystem impacts and toxicity of GM crops, human health and safety and the socioeconomic impacts on farmers related to the higher cost, and ownership and control of GM seeds and products in comparison to conventional production practices. \rThe use of more fertilisers and irrigation can also increase crop yields, if the required resources (water, energy) are available. However, as well as being energy and greenhouse gas intensive, increasing these inputs can have negative impacts on the environment. For example, fertilisers can cause eutrophication (a rapid increase in algal growth which starves the water of oxygen, killing fish and other creatures) if allowed to run off into water bodies, affecting local biodiversity. Irrigation can affect local hydrological conditions, impacting soil and water quality. However, if best practice is applied, these impacts should be minimised. \r\rTo represent a move towards an organic farming system in the Global Calculator, crop yields are likely to be lower than industrialised systems, therefore between Level 1 to level 2 for crop yields would be most appropriate. On a global average, organic crop yields tend to be lower than those of industrialised systems. This would likely result in more land being required to grow crops compared to industrialised systems, and hence could result in deforestation to make way for more agricultural land unless offset to some extent by a concurrent increase in land use efficiency. However, organic farming could have benefits on existing arable land by, for example, reducing soil erosion, the use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, and increasing biodiversity.\r\rFinally, it is important to bear in mind that climate change could impact crop yields in the future. For example, increases in temperature could result in increased weather variability, more frequent and intense extreme events, and changes in precipitation, which in turn could lead to reduced and more variable crop yields. On the other hand, increased carbon dioxide levels could potentially result in improved yields for some types of crops.  Low to moderate yield increases (level 1 to 2) are likely to be the most appropriate if you have chosen a pathway with high temperature increases (>4 degrees) to reflect the potential adverse impacts of climate change on agricultural production.","许多专家认为，截止到2050年粮食产量很有可能持续上升，在发展中国家尤为如此。在这些国家中，粮食的实际产量和依靠农业生态规范的潜在产量之间存在巨大差别。以下是几种提高粮食产量的方法，包括增加作物种类和提高它们的（1）光合作用率，（2）对害虫、疾病、盐类环境和干旱的耐受性，和（3）水和营养元素的利用率。这包括传统植物培植办法（年度高产作物选种、新品种的培育），标记辅助培植和／或转基因技术（转基因：将特定基因转入目标作物生命体内，通常是在不同物种之间进行的）。\r\r传统植物培植办法已有几个世纪的历史，而转基因技术是近几十年才发展起来的。然而，转基因作物的种植面积已达一亿七千万公顷（世界资源研究所，2013），占2011年农作物种植总面积的12%；当前，转基因作物中的大部分（90%）生长在美国、加拿大、巴西、阿根廷和印度。转基因作物的潜在影响还颇具争议。争论主要在于潜在生态系统影响和转基因作物的毒性、人类健康和安全、高成本带来的对农民的社会经济影响、与传统生产实践相对应的转基因种子及作物的所有权和控制问题。若能获得所需资源（水和能量），那么提高肥料和灌溉投入也能提高农作物产量。可是，除了增加能源消耗和温室气体排放量外，这一投入的增加还会对环境产生消极影响。例如，肥料若流入水域中，会导致水体富营养化（藻类数量急剧增加，大量消耗水体中的氧气，导致鱼类和其他生物死亡），影响当地生物多样性。灌溉会改变当地水文状况，影响土壤和水体质量。然而，若能采取最佳措施，那么这些不利影响就会降到最低。\r\r作为全球能源供需情景模拟器中的有机农业系统的一大转变，农作物产量有可能会低于工业化系统，因而1级到2级对于农作物产量而言是最合适的。从全球平均水平看，有机作物产量会比在工业化系统下来得低。作物种植相较于工业化系统就有可能需要更多土地，因而除非在某种程度上同时提高土地利用率，否则为了满足农业用地需求，森林面积就会减少。但有机农业能对现有耕地产生有利影响，如减缓土壤侵蚀、减少化肥和杀虫剂的使用以及增加生物多样性。\r\r最后，必须谨记于心的一点是未来气候变化会影响农作物产量。例如，气温上升会增加天气变化的不确定性，提高极端天气的出现的频率和强度，改变降水量，这些都会减少农作物产量，增加其不稳定性。另一方面，CO2级别上升可能增加某些作物的产量。如果选择高增温路径（高于4摄氏度）来反映气候变化对农业生产的潜在不利影响，那么中低产量的增加（1-2级）可能是最合适的。"],

["This lever controls the increase in efficiency of land from 2011 to 2050 produced through the use of land integration schemes, for example multi-cropping.  This concept is different from crop yield improvements, which are controlled by other levers that just calculate how much land is required to produce a given amount of energy when land is dedicated to that purpose only.","此条目用于调节2011-2050年间土地利用率的上升情况，方法是利用如复种在内的土地整合方案。这一概念不同于产量提升。产量提升是由其他方法调节的。这些方法只计算当土地只用于产生能源时，一定量的能源需要的土地面积是多少。"],
["If land management is integrated more in the future and used for multiple purposes such as multi-cropping (where more than one harvest takes places each year), co-cropping (where two or more crops are grown together), and agro-livestock-forestry schemes, less land may be required to achieve the same outputs than if each land use was managed separately. However, if arable land is cultivated less intensively, more land may be required.","如果未来土地管理能更为综合，用于实现多种目的，如复种制度（每年能收获一种以上的作物）、互作制度（两种或两种以上作物共同生长）以及农牧林方案，那么相较于土地分割管理而言，相同产量所需的土地面积就会减少。但是，若耕地不能集约化耕作，那将会需要更多土地。"],
["The Multiple Cropping Index (MCI) is a measure of the total harvested area for crops, in comparison to the total arable land dedicated to crops. Currently, in some warm climates with irrigation, or sufficient rainfall, crops are harvested more than once per year, hence the MCI is greater than 1; for example, the MCI of China was 1.45 in 2013 (Langeveld et al, 2013). However, if land is cropped less than once per year (e.g. some land is left fallow), the MCI is less than 1; for example, the MCI of the USA was 0.84 in 2013. If increased cropping intensities caused the global average MCI to increase in the future, less land would be required to produce the required amount of food, hence the land use efficiency would increase.\rSome studies have predicted that significant increases in cropping intensities could be technically feasible in the future, via more multi-cropping and reduced fallow periods. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012) project that between 2005/7 and 2050, the global average MCI will increase from 0.88 to 0.92; this represents a change in the land required to produce the crops (assuming constant yields) from 100% in 2005/7 to 95.5% in 2050. \r\rHowever, the environmental implications of such increased cropping intensities will depend on where and how the intensification occurs. For example, long-term fallow land that is harvested infrequently can have substantial carbon reserves and provide important ecosystem services, therefore cultivating this type of land more frequently could result in increased carbon emissions to the atmosphere, and declining ecosystem services (WRI, 2013). However, if arable land that is technically suitable for multi-cropping is used, such schemes could result in improvements in land-use efficiency, without having detrimental environmental implications.  In contrast, with mismanaged land use, such as multi-cropping on land not suitable to such practices, yields could decrease because of soil degradation, soil loss and/or desertification and could result in a net increase of land area required to produce the same amount of output (decrease in land use efficiency).\r\rAnother way to increase the integration of land use, and potentially the land-use efficiency, is to use agroforestry, where trees and shrubs are integrated on land with crops and/or livestock production. Agroforestry schemes are already deployed in many regions, including Latin America, Asia and Africa. As well as potentially reducing overall land requirements, there are other potential environmental benefits of such schemes, including fixing nitrogen in the soils, reducing soil erosion, increasing soil organic matter, and increasing pasture yields in hot regions by providing shade and hence reducing animal stress. For example, in Kenya, Zambia and Malawi, nitrogen-fixing tree species (e.g. Faidherbia) are being intercropped with crops, improving the nitrogen content of soils. In other regions, shrubs with high-protein leaves (e.g. Leucaena) are being inter-cropped to provide forage for livestock (WRI, 2013). These schemes have proved very successful and are therefore increasingly being deployed in other countries.","复种指数（MCI）是用于衡量作物总收获面积的指标，与之相对应的是用于衡量作物总耕种面积的指标。目前，在某些气候温暖且有灌溉或丰沛降水条件的地区，作物每年成熟的次数超过一次，因而复种指数就大于1；例如，2013年中国的复种指数为1.45（兰格威尔德等人，2013）。但若土地每年耕种的次数不足一次（比如有些土地处于休耕期），那么复种指数就小于1；例如，2013年美国的复种指数为0.84。如果未来由于耕种强度的提高使得全球平均复种指数上升，那么生产一定量的粮食所需的土地面积就会变小，从而提高了土地利用率。一些研究预计，若延长复种期并缩短休耕期，那么理论上耕种强度的显著提升在未来是有可能实现的。联合国粮农组织（FAO）（Alexandratos and Bruinsma，2012）预计，从2005/7年到2050年间，全球平均复种指数会上升到0.88至0.92；这表明种植作物（假定是恒定产量）所需的土地面积将从2005/7年的100%下降至2050年的95.5%。 \r\r然而，这一耕种强度的提升带来的环境影响将取决于强度的变化是在何地且如何发生的。例如，长期处于休耕期的土地收获作物的频率较低，这类土地有大量碳存量，能提供重要的生态系统服务，因而更多地耕种这类土地会增加大气中的碳排放量，减少生态系统服务（世界资源研究所，2013）但是，如果对理论上适合复种的耕地进行耕作，那这些方案就将提高土地利用率，也不会对环境产生不利影响。相反，如果土地利用不当，如对某些不符合条件的土地采取复种措施，那么土地退化、水土流失和／或土地沙漠化就会导致农作物产量下降，还会导致生产等量粮食所需土地面积的净增长（即土地利用率的下降）。 \r\r另一种提高土地利用的整合率和潜在土地利用率的方法是发展农林业，即在土地上同时种植树木和灌木以及农作物和／或饲养家畜。农林业方案已在许多地区得到运用，包括拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲。除了可以减少所需的土地总面积，这类方案对环境还会有其他有利影响，包括将氮固定在土壤中，减缓土壤侵蚀，增加土壤中的有机质含量，以及通过树荫遮蔽来增加牧草产量从而减轻动物的压力。例如，在肯尼亚、赞比亚和马拉维，能进行氮固定的植物品种（如金合欢）已与农作物一同种植，以此来提高土壤中的氮含量。在其他地区，树叶中蛋白质含量高的灌木（如银合欢）也和农作物一同种植来为家畜提供饲料（世界能源研究所，2013）。这些方案已获成功，因而被越来越多地运用于其他国家。"],

Currently, intensively produced beef represents approximately 6% of all beef, and 1% of all sheep and goat meat produced globally. Since the 1990s, livestock production has been shifting from more developed countries to developing countries, and this pattern is projected to continue towards 2050 (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). Developing countries currently produce less than 1% of their beef from intensive systems, whereas developed countries produce around12% from such systems. Therefore the shift of beef production to developing countries could result in reduced intensification of beef production. However, intensification of livestock systems is generally associated with economic growth, therefore it is expected that there will be a gradual shift towards more intensive feed-lot systems in developing countries in the future; this could compensate for the shift of livestock production from developed to developing countries. \r\rIt is expected that global average feed conversion efficiencies of grain/residue fed animals will increase in the future due to genetic improvements, as well as improved animal feeds.","反刍动物类家畜（如奶牛和其他牛类动物、绵羊、山羊）可饲养在草场上或集约和半集约的围栏肥育地系统内，它们在其中以谷物和残余物为食。目前，集中生产的牛肉约占牛肉总量的6%，羊肉总量中有1%是在全球范围内生产的。自20世纪90年代以来，家畜生产已从发达国家转移到发展中国家，这一模式预计会持续到2050年（亚历山德拉托斯, 布鲁因斯马, 2012）。目前，发展中国家只有不到1%的牛肉是在集约系统下生产出来的，而在发达国家这一比重达到12%。因此，将牛肉生产转移到发展中国家会削弱牛肉的集约化生产。然而，家畜系统的集约化通常与经济增长联系在一起，因而未来在发展中国家预计围栏肥育地系统的集约化程度会逐渐提高；这可以弥补家畜生产从发达国家转移到发展中国家带来的损失。 \r\r据估计，得益于基因技术的发展和动物饲料的改进，未来全球以谷物／残余物为食的动物的平均饲料转化率将会提高。"],
["Livestock produced in intensive systems are generally much more efficient at converting biomass food to meat, and therefore require much less land than pasture-fed animals. For example, in 2011 an area the size of a football pitch would typically yield ~ 380,000 kcal per year of intensively managed beef, but only ~ 26,000 kcal per year of pasture fed beef, i.e., almost 15 times less. Shifting more towards intensively produced animals could therefore free up land for other uses, such as newly established forests and bioenergy plantations. \r\rHowever, intensive livestock operations are currently a source of environmental and health problems. Large amounts of manure are produced in confined areas, and its collection, storage and application to land can pose significant challenges; for example, if too much manure is added to nearby land, it can run-off into local water systems, causing water and soil pollution. There are also concerns of odour and air pollution associated with feedlot systems. Another issue is that antibiotics are often used in large quantities in feedlot systems, with potential health implications for humans (e.g. increased human resistance to antibiotics). \r\rMany people are also concerned about the health and welfare impacts on animals by keeping them in confined, intensive conditions, as well as using selective breeding (for example, to make them more muscular).","一般来说，与在草场上生长的动物相比，在集约化系统下饲养出来的家畜能更有效地将生物量转化为肉类，所需要的土地面积也更少。例如，2011年，一块足球场大小的土地每年一般可以产出约380000千千卡集约化生产的牛肉，但只能产出约26000千千卡放牧形式喂养的牛肉，也就是说后者产量比前者少了近15倍。因而，更多地采取集约化的养殖方式可以节约土地挪作他用，如植树造林和新建生物能种植园。 \r\r然而，目前集约化的家畜养殖方式会带来环境和健康问题。有限空间内产生了大量粪肥，它的收集、储存和利用都存在巨大挑战；例如，如果附近的土地上有过多的粪肥的话，它就会排入当地的水体中，造成水土污染。围栏肥育地系统还会带来恶臭，造成空气污染。该系统的另一问题是频繁使用大量抗生素，这会对人体健康带来隐患（如人体对抗生素的抗药性增强）。 \r\r许多人还担心把动物置于狭窄的、集中的环境下并进行选择性交配繁殖（如让它们更强壮），会对动物的安全与健康产生不利影响。"],

It is thought that there is significant potential to increase pasture-fed livestock yields globally, particularly in countries with land availability for livestock production or by increasing the animal density in existent pasture systems.","反刍动物类家畜（如奶牛和其他牛类动物、绵羊、山羊）可饲养在草场上或集约和半集约的围栏肥育地系统内，它们在其中以谷物和残余物为食。目前，草场上产出的牛肉约占牛肉总量的94%，羊肉总量中有99%是在全球范围内生产的(世界粮农组织，2006)；2050年草场系统预计将继续产出大多数的牛羊肉。 \r\r通过增加草场系统中每公顷动物的数量，并提高动物的饲料转化率（动物消耗每千千卡生物量与所得的肉类千千卡重量的比值），可以提高草场家畜的产量。全球范围内草场家畜的产量极有可能得到提高，尤其是在有适宜家畜生长的土地的国家，或是可以通过提升现存草场系统的动物密度来增加产量。"],
["Pasture land currently covers 3.4 billion hectares of the world, representing 26% of the overall global land area (excluding deserts, ice sheets, degraded lands). If global consumption of pasture-fed ruminant meat increases in the future, more pasture land will be required unless increases in efficiencies are able to counterbalance this increased meat requirement. Increases in pasture area could lead to further deforestation, with the associated greenhouse gas emissions and impacts on biodiversity. Alternatively, if pasture yields and other land use efficiency measures (controlled by the “Land-use efficiency” lever which allows greater multi-cropping and land use integration) were increased significantly, this pasture expansion could be prevented, or even reversed so that some pasture land is freed up in the future and used for either reforestation or dedicated bioenergy crop production.  \r\rThere are several methods for increasing pasture yields. For example, pastures could be planted with grasses and legumes that are more digestible than typical pasture forage, and fields could be fertilised to produce greater quantities of forage. This could increase the number of animals that the land could support, as well as raising the feed conversion efficiency of the animals (if the forage is more digestible). Grains and oilseed meals could also be used as a supplement feed to grass, to help maintain the animal’s growth during dry or cold seasons. \r\rAlternatively, grazing methods can be improved so that pasture land is used more efficiently; for example, by rotating animals quickly around different areas of a field so that grass growth is optimised, or by mixing cattle and sheep grazing so that their different grazing patterns complement each other. Agro-livestock integration can also maximise the land use and increase the overall productivity. Finally, genetic improvements could also be used to increase the feed conversion ratio of ruminants, and reduce their production of methane.","当前，世界牧场面积达34亿公顷，占全球土地面积（不包括沙漠、冰原和退化的土地）的26%。若未来全球牧场反刍动物肉制品消费量呈上升趋势，那就将需要更多的草场，除非土地利用率的上升能抵消增加的肉类需求。草场利用的增加会进一步减小森林面积，同时会增加温室气体排放，影响生物多样性。或者，如果草场产量和其他土地利用率指标（受“土地利用率”杠杆影响，这会扩大复种面积，推进土地利用一体化）显著提升，草场的扩张就能得到抑制，甚至能够节约草场面积，使得一部分空闲草场能用于植树造林或种植生物能作物。有一些办法能增加草场产量。例如，草场可以种植草和豆科植物，这些作物比常见的草料更易消化吸收，土壤也能变得更肥沃，从而产出更多的草料。这能增加土地上养殖的动物数量，并提高动物的饲料转化率（如果草料更易消化的话）。谷物和含油种子也可以作为除草料外的补充饲料，在干燥或寒冷季节为动物提供生命所需的营养物质。 \r\r另外，可以改进放牧方式以优化草料的生长情况，或者将牛羊混合放养，使得两种不同的放牧方式互为补充。农畜一体化也可使土地利用率最大化，提高总生产力。最后，转基因技术的进步也能用于提高反刍动物的饲料转化率，减少甲烷的产生。"],

["In order to produce a given amount of bioenergy, the amount of land we need depends on the bioenergy crop yield, as controlled by this lever. \r\rLiquid biofuels are primarily produced in the USA, Brazil, Europe and China from food crops (known as first generation feedstocks). For example maize, sugar cane and wheat can be made into ethanol, and oilseed rape, soybean and palm fruits can be made into biodiesel. The yield of these crops varies between regions and crop type. For example, the energy yield of wheat grown in Europe is currently around 2,500 litres of ethanol per hectare, whereas the energy yield of sugar cane grown in Brazil is about 7,500 litres of ethanol per hectare.","生产规定数量的生物能所需的土地面积取决于为此条目所调节的生物能作物的产量。 \r\r液态生物燃料主要是由美国、巴西、欧洲和中国从粮食作物中生产出来的（即第一代生质燃料）。例如，玉米、甘蔗和小麦能用于生产乙醇，油菜、大豆和棕榈果能用于生产生物柴油。这些作物的产量因产地和品种而异。例如，目前欧洲每公顷小麦的能源产量能生产约2500升的乙醇，而巴西每公顷甘蔗的能源产量能生产约7500升乙醇。"],
["This lever considers not only the increase in energy crop yields, but also a change in the crop mix. For example, more efficient energy crops are likely to prevail in future bioenergy investments, particularly with the advancements of new technologies, such as using a more efficient mix of first generation feedstocks, or using second-generation biofuels made through lignocellulosic processes. These feedstocks are generally woody or grassy, such as switchgrass, sugarcane, Miscanthus, napier grass, and eucalyptus, rather than food crops. If we were to move towards using these ‘second generation’ energy crops in the future, the energy yield would be expected to increase.\r\rImprovements in crop varieties should also result in increased yields of energy crops in the future. In the literature, annual increases for global average yields of woody energy crops up to 2050 are projected to be 1.2–1.6% (AEA, 2011), corresponding to an increase of 59% - 86% increase in 2050 over 2011 yields. These improvements could be achieved using traditional plant breeding methods (annual selection of higher yielding seeds, and the development of new varieties) or genetic modification (the insertion of specific genes into the genes of a target plant, often from a separate species). \r\rThe “land use efficiency” lever also affects how much bioenergy can be produced per unit of land.","此条目不仅是关于能源作物产量的增长的，还是有关作物比例变化的。例如，更高效的能源作物将在未来生物能投资领域中占据主导地位，尤其是借助新技术的发展，如采用更高效的第一代生质燃料混合物，或使用由木素纤维素制成的第二代生物燃料。这些给料通常是木本或草本的，如柳枝稷、甘蔗、芒草、象草和桉树，而不是粮食作物。如果我们未来选择使用这些“第二代”能源作物，那么能源产出预计将会提高。 \r\r今后作物种类的增多也会提高能源作物的产量。据资料显示，到2050年全球木本能源作物的年均增产量预计将达到1.2-1.6%（英国能源与环保技术援助公司，2011），即2050年的产量将比2011年增长59%-86%。这些增量可以通过运用传统植物培植方式（年度高产作物选种、新品种的培育）或转基因技术（将特定基因转入目标作物生命体内，通常是在不同物种之间进行的））来实现。 \r\r“土地利用率”条目也反映了单位土地面积能生产多少生物能。"],

For example, in developing countries, simple, low-cost storage options could be provided to low-income farmers to help preserve food. Improved roads, access to electricity, and refrigeration could also reduce losses from food production, handling, transport and storage in developing countries. In developed countries, consumer waste could be reduced by improving packaging so that food lasts longer and providing advice to consumers on food storage and the difference between ‘sell-by’ and ‘use by’ dates.

["The IEA suggests that with best practice technologies, process improvements, CHP, recycling and energy recovery, over 13 EJ could be saved globally from chemical production, compared to current production methods.

["Paper is a natural material produced from pulp, and is used for a wide array of applications such as writing and office paper, hygiene and packaging. Although many types of fibre can be used for paper production, wood fibres are the main feedstock (other types of fibres have not been assessed in the scope of this calculator).\r\rAfter the introduction of modern workstation computers in the 1980s, some predicted a decline in the paper industry; however, paper demand has continued to grow. Annual global paper demand was 363 Mt per year in 2005. By 2050, the global paper demand is expected to be 2.4 times higher still.\r\rIn 2011, the global average emission intensity of pulp & paper production was 0.65 tCO2e per tonne produced (including both virgin and recycled paper).

["Paper can be made either from virgin fibres or from recycled fibres. The proportion of virgin and recycled paper is selected in the lever “design, materials & recycling”. \r\rFor virgin fibres, an average of 24 trees are needed to produce one tonne of writing or printing paper. High demand for wood products, such as paper, has resulted in deforestation in the past, as well as the conversion of natural forest to industrial plantations, with negative implications for stored carbon and biodiversity. Given that fibre recycling is less energy intensive and consumes less biomass than using virgin wood for paper production, paper recycling provides an eco-friendly solution to this problem if the usage of harmful chemicals is avoided. From 1991 to 2009, paper-recycling rates in the EU and North America increased from around 40% to over 60%, and this trend is continuing. \r\rSeveral process and energy efficiency improvements are possible in the paper industry. For example, the drying step is typically very energy intensive and could be re-engineered to reduce energy requirements. Fuel switches could also reduce emissions, for example, by using biomass co-products and by-products such as black liquor to provide energy for the process, rather than coal. Such fuel switches could be combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the future to reduce emissions. In the global calculator, the application of CCS technologies can be regulated with the lever “CCS (manufacturing)”. Finally, Combined Heat and Power (CHP) technologies could be used to provide process heat and electricity requirements in a more efficient manner in the future.\r\rThe amount of biomass that is required as a fuel for paper and other manufacturing is accounted for in the calculations for the supply of biomass. In the Global Calculator, the maximum amount of biomass required for manufacturing is therefore determined, and then assessed against the biomass supply determined by other levers to determine the amount of fossil fuels that are substituted by biomass. ","原生纤维和再生纤维都可用来生产纸张。原生纸和再生纸的比例由条目“工艺、原料和回收”决定。\r\r对原生纤维而言，平均需用24棵树来生产一吨的书写或打印用纸。过去，因包括纸张在内的木材制品需求量巨大而导致森林大面积减少，自然林变为人工林，给森林的储碳容量和生物多样性带来负面影响。考虑到造纸过程中，再生纤维与原生木材比起来所需能源少，消耗的生物质也更少，因而如果能避免使用有害化工产品，那么纸张回收再利用就为上述问题提供了有利于生态保护的解决方法。1991-2009年间，欧盟和北美的纸张回收再效率从约40%上升到了超过60%，并且这一趋势仍在继续。\r\r一些工艺和能源效率的改进方法在造纸业是有可能实现的。例如，脱水步骤通常需要消耗大量能源，可重新设计工艺来减少这一环节的能源需求。燃料替代也能减少碳排放，如可用生物质联产或副产的制浆黑液来提供能源，来代替煤炭。未来，此类燃料替代工艺可与碳捕集与封存（CCS）共同使用来减少碳排放。在全球计算器中，条目“碳捕集与封存（制造业）”可控制碳捕集与封存技术的应用。最后，热电联产（CHP）技术在未来能以更高效的方式来提供生产所需的热能和电力。\r\r生物质作为造纸业和其他制造业所需的燃料，其总量是根据生物质的供应量数据来分析计算的。因此，在全球计算器中，制造业生产过程所需的生物质的最大量得以计算出来，然后估算由其他条目控制的生物质供应量，进而计算用以替代生物质的化石燃料总量。"],

The main proposed method involves grinding minerals like olivine (magnesium silicate) into a fine dust, which will react more quickly because of the higher surface-area-to-volume ratio.","随着硅酸盐矿物质的降解，它们从大气中吸收二氧化碳，并以碳酸盐矿物质的形式固定下来。强化陆地作用吸收二氧化碳旨在加快这一原本极其缓慢的自然过程。提出的主要方法是将如橄榄石（硅酸镁）这样的矿物质磨成细粉，以此来增大单位体积反应物的接触面积，从而加快反应速率。"],
["• Energy penalty and costs: the energy and cost requirements for grinding appropriate minerals sufficiently are high.\r• Impacts on human health: the particle size to which such minerals need to be ground to is often smaller than 10 microns in diameter - a size which can cause harm to health.\r• Geological constraints: there is an upper limit as to the amount of carbon dioxide that can be sequestered via this method, based on the saturation state of silicic acid that is produced when the magnesium silicate reacts.\r• Land use impacts: this technique will affect soils, for example by introducing trace metals present in the olivine, changing the pH. The places currently identified as most suitable for enhanced weathering (tropical areas that have high rainfall and high temperatures) are also some of the most important areas for biodiversity globally. \r• Transboundary effects: while EW-T would occur on territory under the jurisdiction of individual states, runoff from EW-T could have transboundary effects by altering the pH of river systems and potentially enhancing the saturation state of silicic acid in coastal waters. ","• 能量损失和成本：研磨够充足的矿石所需要的能量和成本都很高。\r• 影响人类健康：这种矿物质需要被研磨成通常小于10微米的直径的颗粒 - 这种微小颗粒会有害人体健康。\r• 地质约束：通过这种方法来固定的二氧化碳有一个上限，而这一上限决定于在硅酸镁反应的过程中硅酸的饱和状态。\r• 对土地利用的影响：这种技术将对土壤产生影响，例如将会将橄榄石中的微量金属释放出来，改变土壤的pH值。目前被确定为最适宜实现强化陆地作用吸收二氧化碳的地区（有强降雨和高温的热带地区），同时也是部分对全球生物多样性最重要的地区。\r•跨国界影响：虽然强化陆地作用吸收二氧化碳技术会发生在各个国家的独立管辖境内，该技术应用地流经的河流可能会发生水系pH值的改变，并可能潜在地加强沿海水域硅酸的饱和程度，从而产生跨国界的影响。"],
["Enhanced weathering (terrestrial) (EW-T) has been studied in the laboratory and has been modelled, but it has had little research in the open environment (although proponents of EW-T have marketed ground olivine as a soil additive already). Technical and theoretical modelling of the particle sizes indicate that while there would be some carbon dioxide drawdown, it is far less than has been claimed. Due to these uncertainties, this mitigation measure is considered to be speculative in the Global Calculator.","强化陆地作用吸收二氧化碳的温室气体减排措施已进入实验阶段，并进行了模拟研究，但几乎没有在开放环境下进行过试验（虽然该技术的支持者已开始将地表的橄榄石作为土壤添加剂进行销售）。颗粒尺寸的技术和理论模型表明，虽然会有一些二氧化碳的减少，远远小于预期值。因此，鉴于这些不确定因素，该减排措施在全球计算器中被认为是仍停留在纯理论阶段。"],
["Biochar","生物炭"],
["Biomass contains carbon taken from the carbon dioxide air through the process of photosynthesis. Heating biomass in an oxygen-deficient environment results in incomplete combustion and the production of a char that has high carbon content, some of which is ‘recalcitrant’ (meaning resistant to decomposing and being re-released back into the atmosphere). If this char is buried, then this carbon is sequestered away from the atmosphere. ","生物质中含有通过植物光合作用的过程从空气中的二氧化碳中固定下来的碳。在厌氧环境下加热生物质将导致其不完全燃烧，并产生具有较高碳元素含量的炭，一部分“​​顽固”的碳（具有耐分解属性，且不易被重新释放回大气中）。如果这个碳被埋存起来，那么它将永远与大气隔绝。"],
["• Carbon stability: the proportion of recalcitrant carbon in a biochar is a function of many factors: the biomass feedstock, the method of producing the biochar, and the characteristics of the soil into which the biochar is placed. \r• Dispute for natural resources: the availability of biomass to produce the biochar.\r• Impacts on human health: Biochar dust poses a potential hazard to human health.\r• Impacts on soil biota: The addition of biochar alters the property of the soil. In many cases it can lead to enhanced crop yields. However, it can also lead to increased production of methane, and cause impacts on the biological diversity of the soil.\r• Albedo effect: the addition of large amounts of biochar to soils may result in reduced albedo (ability of the surface of the earth to reflect heat energy from the sun), thereby counteracting some of the cooling benefit of removing carbon dioxide.\r• Fire impacts: if a land area into which biochar has been added is affected by fire (e.g. fire use as an agronomical practice, accidental fire, or even as the result of a warming climate), then the carbon stored may be released back into the atmosphere.","• 碳稳定性：在一个生物炭中“顽固”碳分子的比例是由许多因素决定的：生物质原料、生产生物炭的方法和最终埋存生物炭的土壤属性。\r•争夺自然资源：获得生产生物炭的生物质资源。\r• 对人体健康的影响：生物炭粉尘可能成为危害人类健康的潜在影响因素。\r• 对土壤生物的影响：土壤中添加生物炭会改变土壤的性质。许多案例证明，它可以提高作物的产量。然而，它同样也可能导致甲烷产量增加，并对土壤的生物多样性产生影响。\r• 影响反射率：土壤加入大量的生物炭可能导致降低土壤的反射率（即地球的表面反射太阳热能的能力），从而抵消部分因减少二氧化碳而产生的减缓全球变暖的冷却效果。\r• 火灾的影响：如果成添加了生物炭的土地受到火的影响（如用作农艺实践中的火、意外失火、或由于干热气候的影响），那么储存起来的碳可能就会被释放回大气中。"],
["Biochar is produced from the pyrolysis of biomass, similar to the production of charcoal. Research is underway to enhance the understanding of the long-term behaviour of biochar as a means of storing carbon away from the atmosphere (sequestration potential). Due to these uncertainties, this mitigation measure is considered to be speculative in the Global Calculator.","生物炭是生物质高温分解过程的产物，其生产过程类似于木炭。生物炭这种从大气中储存碳（封存潜力）的极佳手段应该作为一种长期行为，而为了强化人们对这一事实的理解，更多的研究也在进行之中。因此，鉴于这些不确定因素，该减排措施在全球计算器中被认为是仍停留在纯理论阶段。"],
["Direct air capture","直接空气捕捉"],
["Direct air capture (DAC) involves using chemical processes to directly capture carbon dioxide from ambient air. Typically this will involve using an alkaline material (such as sodium hydroxide) which reacts with carbon dioxide, or a material which adsorbs the carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is then stored underground in suitable geological formations. DAC differs from carbon capture and storage (CCS), in that CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide from large stationary sources, such as power plants or cement plants (4-30% concentration) rather than from ambient air (~0.04% concentration). ","直接空气捕捉（DAC）包括通过化学处理直接从环境空气中捕捉二氧化碳。典型的，使用一种能够与二氧化碳反应的碱性物质（例如氢氧化钠），或者使用能够吸附二氧化碳的物质。然后二氧化碳会被储藏在地理构造合适的地底。直接空气捕捉技术不同于碳捕集和封存（CCS）技术的是因为碳捕集和封存技术捕捉的二氧化碳有大量的固定来源，例如电厂或者水泥厂释放的二氧化碳（浓度4-30%）要多于环境空气中的二氧化碳（浓度约为0.04%）。"],
["• Energy penalty: this is the amount of energy that is required to run such systems, which may counteract the carbon savings made through the DAC process.\r• Physical constraints: given the low initial concentration of carbon dioxide in ambient air, it is necessary to treat 1.4 million cubic metres of air to remove a single tonne of carbon dioxide. These volumes indicate that the scale of the machinery is likely to be large with significant resource implications.\r• Water: many, but not all, DAC techniques have a significant water requirement.\r• Costs: it is unlikely that DAC from ambient air will be cost competitive with CCS, as the starting concentration of the carbon dioxide feedstock is so much lower. It would make economic sense to first exhaust all potential CCS opportunities before applying DAC. The exception to this would be if large quantities of extra low-carbon energy ¬¬¬(known as “stranded energy”) were available in locations close to geological storage sites.\r• Geological storage: DAC will compete with geological storage space with CCS from large stationary plants.","• 能量损失：是运行系统所需求的能量总量，有可能会直接将空气捕捉过程中节约下来的碳抵消。\r• 物理条件：给定环境空气中的二氧化碳量是低初始条件，为了移除一吨的二氧化碳必须要处理140万立方米空气。这些体积表明，机械的规模要与显著的环境影响相匹配。\r• 水资源：直接空气捕捉技术需要大量的水，但并不是全部需求。\r• 成本：在成本方面，直接空气捕捉这种从环境空气吸收的方式很难与CCS相比较，因为二氧化碳原料的初始浓度非常低。因此如果从经济价值的角度考虑，在应用直接空气捕捉技术之前，所有可能的机会可能都会被用来上CCS装置。而例外可能就在于，如果大量数量的低碳资源被称作“标准资源”）可开采并且位置与储存碳的地理位置相近。\r• 地理存储：直接空气捕捉技术会与地里储存方式从大型固定工厂中竞争空间。"],
["There are about a dozen proposed Direct Air Capture (DAC) technologies that have been demonstrated at small scales. Technically the process works – in fact, the removal of carbon dioxide from ambient air in submarines and spacecraft has been practised for decades. The real questions are around the carbon balance of the systems and the economics. Due to these uncertainties, this mitigation measure is considered to be speculative in the Global Calculator.","已经有十几个直接空气捕捉技术（DAC）的支持者已经在进行小规模的示范。严格意义上讲，这个过程是可行的——事实是，几十年以来他们一直在用潜艇和飞行器清除二氧化碳。而问题主要围绕在碳的系统平衡和经济性上。因此，鉴于这些不确定因素，该减排措施在全球计算器中被认为是仍停留在纯理论阶段。"],
["Ocean fertilisation","海洋富养化"],
["Ocean fertilisation (OF) involves enhancing the biological capacity of the oceans to draw down more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Photosynthesising organisms incorporate carbon dioxide from the air into their cells as they grow and multiply. Some of this carbon will eventually end up in the deep ocean where it will be effectively stored away from the atmosphere. Some parts of the ocean are deficient in micronutrients such as iron, which organisms need to grow. By adding iron filings, more photosynthesis can occur and more carbon can be transported from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. ","海洋富养化（OF）包括加强海洋生物的降解作用，来降低更多大气中二氧化碳的含量。可以进行光合作用的生物随着生长和繁殖，其细胞会从空气中吸收二氧化碳。一部分碳元素会通过这种方式被带离大气层并被有效的存放。有些地区的海洋由于缺乏生物生长必备微量元素，如有机物生长所必需的铁元素。通过加入铁屑，将会产生更多能够发生光合作用的生物，因此就会把更多的二氧化碳从大气层运到海洋深处。"],
["• Biological constraints: The effectiveness of OF is limited by the area of ocean that is deficient in micronutrients. Once iron is no longer a constraint, photosynthetic activity can increase up to the point that the next constraining factor limits growth (typically the availability of nitrate).\r• Logistics: some proponents of OF have suggested that it may be possible to boost macronutrients such as nitrate as a means of enhancing photosynthetic capacity. While that may be possible, the quantity of material that is required to boost photosynthesis may be impractical.\r• Impacts on marine biodiversity: serious environmental concerns have been raised about OF. The introduction of micronutrients into the ocean will alter its ecology, favouring certain types of organism over others that thrive in low-iron waters. In addition, increased photosynthetic activity could lead to increased ocean acidification and a decrease in dissolved oxygen.\r• Efficacy: it is not sufficient for photosynthetic activity to just increase – for the technique to have a positive impact on the climate, the carbon must be transferred from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. Some studies show that a large fraction of the carbon is released back into the atmosphere as the algae die or enter the food chain, so the efficacy of the technique has been questioned. \r• Governance: the governance issues relating to OF are complicated. Rules established by the London Convention/London Protocol (LC/LP) restrict activities to small-scale scientific experiments, while the Convention on Biological Diversity also seeks to restrict such activities.","• 生物制约：海洋富养化的效果受限于海洋内缺乏的微量元素。一旦铁元素不再是约束，光合作用生物的数量和活跃度会增长到下一个制约点出现的位置（典型的如硝酸盐的可用量）。\r• 保障措施：一些海洋富养化的支持者建议通过增加类似于硝酸盐这类的常化营养元素来提高光合作用生物的容量。虽然这是可行的，但促生光合作用生物生长所需物质的数量是一个天文数字。\r• 对海洋生物多样性的影响：对海洋富养化产生的环境问题已受到了严密关注。微量营养素进入海洋的推出将改变其生态平衡，导致某些特定的生物体数量激增，以至于超过那些活跃在低铁水域的有机体。此外，增加光合作用生物的活动可能导致海洋酸性增加和溶氧量的减少。\r• 功效：只增加光合作用生物的活性是不足够的——为了该技术能够产生对气候积极的影响，碳元素必须得从大气被转移到深海。一些研究表明，当藻类死亡或进入食物链后，其固定的碳大部分又被释放到了大气中，所以该技术的功效受到了质疑。\r• 治理权：与该技术有关的治理权问题相当复杂。伦敦公约/伦敦议定书（ LC / LP ）既定的规则将各国可进行的活动限制在小规模的科学实验内，生物多样性公约也在限制这种活动。"],
["A small number of Ocean fertilisation (OF) experiments have been undertaken, most with the approval of national research establishments, but some without such approval. Those experiments conducted without approval have been highly controversial. The results of the officially approved experiments have indicated, at least in some instances, that there has been a net carbon drawdown, but there are still many unanswered questions as to the long-term effects of this technique. Due to these uncertainties, this mitigation measure is considered to be speculative in the Global Calculator.","仅有一小批海洋富养化（OF）技术的实验正在进行着，其中的大部分都获得了国家级研究机构的批准，但仍有一小部分没有。那些没有被批准的实验饱受争议。获得官方批准的实验结果表明，至少在某些情况下，出现了碳含量净减少，但是还是有很多悬而未决的问题会长期影响这个技术。因此，鉴于这些不确定因素，该减排措施在全球计算器中被认为是仍停留在纯理论阶段。"],

["Therefore, the output from the Global Calculator should only be considered a rough estimate.","因此，全球计算器的结果只能看做是粗略的估计。"],
["A full climate model simulation of your pathway would give more detailed information, but this would require a lot of computer power to run. Because no climate model is perfect, the uncertainty range is then extended to take into account the possible effect of other physical processes which are not yet included in climate models. This uses a method similar to the one used in the most recent IPCC report.","完整的气候模型模拟的路径会给出更详细的信息，但这需要强大的计算机运算能力。而且，因为不存在完美无缺的气候模型，所以其他没有包括到气候模型中的物理过程应该在不确定性的研究中体现。这里所使用的方法类似于最近出版的IPCC报告。"],

There are two reasons why the IPCC stops at this level:","如果您的路径超出如上IPCC图表中所示的[[CO2]]累积排放量，那么您就超过了IPCC所使用的气候模型的评估水平。IPCC停留在这个水平有两个原因："],
["Most simulations of the global economy do not reach such high levels of emissions, and they are considered to be unrealistic. If you have produced a very high emissions pathway, consider whether there may be cost or resource limitations not included by the Global Calculator.","大多数全球经济模拟没有如此高的排放量水平，它们被认为是不现实的。如果您做出了一个非常高水平的排放量路径，可以考虑下全球计算器中是否没有包括成本或资源限制。"],
["Climate models are tested against observations of current and past climates, so we have confidence in the results when there are small changes. However for very large or very rapid climate change, it is likely that other processes and feedbacks will become important which are not currently well understood or well studied, because we have not yet experienced them. Therefore there is larger uncertainty about possible changes at these levels of emissions, and greater risk of unpredictable changes.","气候模型已经使用了当前和过去的气候观测结果进行了测试，所以当计算结果变化很小时，我们对计算结果很有信心。然而对于非常大或者非常快速的气候变化时，其他的影响过程或者结果反馈可能变得很重要，然而这些目前尚未被很好的理解和深入的研究，因为我们尚未有过这方面的经验。因此，在较大水平排放量的变化估计上，将有很大的不确定性，这些不可预知的变化会带来很大的风险。"],

["The animations for temperature, precipitation, and ocean acidification each show a set of alternative possible outcomes in 2100, all of which are consistent with your Global Calculator pathway.  The animations do not show a change over time.  Each of the frames of the animation is an internally self-consistent possible future, according to a single climate model.  By looking at the animation, you can get an idea of what kinds of predictions are common to all models.  For example, all models show that when the global average temperature increases, more of this change is felt over the land than over the ocean, and this means we have high confidence in that prediction.  You can also get an idea of what the models disagree on.  For example, the changes in rainfall over the tropics are very varied between climate models.  This means we have less confidence in the details of those predictions.","气候、降水和海洋酸化的动画都展示了2100年可能出现的替代结果，与您的全球计算器路径一致。它们没有体现一段时间内的变化。根据单一气候模型，动画的每一帧都是内部相照应的可能的未来情景。通过动画，您可以了解到所有模型中常见的预测。例如，所有模型都显示当全球平均温度升高时，土地受到的影响比海洋受到的影响更大，这意味着预测值得信任。您也可以了解到模型间不同的方面。例如，不同气候模型中关于热带地区降雨变化的体现十分不同。也就是说我们对气候模型预测的细节并不是完全信任。"],

["method described here","方法如下"],
["There are two reasons why this is a range rather than a single value.  One reason is that the Global Calculator is a very simplified tool, and we have to make approximations.  A second reason is that climate forecasting is not perfectly accurate: there are many different climate models which make slightly different predictions, resulting in a range of possible outcomes.  This range is shown in the 'thermometer' graphic.","之所以是温度变化范围而不是单一值，有以下两个原因。其中一个原因是全球计算器是一个简化的工具，我们只能给出近似值。第二个原因是气候预测不可能完全准确：许多不同的气候模型给出的预测都略有不同，只有一个可能的温度变化范围。下图温度表列出了这一温度变化范围。"],
["Next, a set of map images are chosen which each have the change in global average temperature within your temperature range.  These are selected from the IPCC database and use different models.  The model used is noted next to the map.  The images are placed in a random order within the animation.  This method is used for temperature, precipitation, and ocean acidification maps: they are all selected with reference to the global average temperature change of your pathway.","接下来，选择了一组地图图像，均在您的温度范围内和全球平均温度范围内变化。它们来自政府间气候变化专门委员会数据库，采用不同气候模型，在地图旁有标注。图像在动画中的排序不分先后。气候、降水和海洋酸化的地图均采用此方法：根据您的路径，以及参考全球平均温度做出选择。"],

["The images that are selected are not all model outputs at 2100.  This is because the standard IPCC scenarios do not cover the full range of possible temperature change in 2100.  Instead, all maps of the intended temperature change (eg 2 degrees) are listed, and then the one which is closest to 2100 is chosen (eg, a 2100-2119 period).  In most cases the maps shown are for the 2090-2109 period.  However, especially for very high and very low pathways, in some cases the maps are for different time periods.","挑选的图像并不都是2100年的输出模型。这是因为标准政府间气候变化专门委员会情景并没有包括2100年所有可能的温度变化。相反，列出全部预期温度变化（例如2摄氏度）地图，选择最接近2100年的地图（例如2100-2119年）。在大多数情况下，地图显示的是2090-2109年间的情况。但部分情况下选择其他时段的地图，特别是对温度特别高或特别低的路径而言。"],

For example, it includes the costs of building and maintaining power stations, wind turbines, heat pumps, boilers, cars, trains, planes, roads, railways and the clean technology used in manufacturing, as well as the fuels, such as fossil fuels and bioenergy, used to power these technologies. It also includes the opportunity cost of finance used to fund capital expenditure.","全球计算器对既定路径的能源系统总成本作出预测。包括到2050年全球能源系统的资金、运行与燃料成本。例如，这其中包括建造和维护发电站、风力涡轮、热泵、锅炉、汽车、火车、飞机、公路、铁路、制造业中使用的清洁技术和支持这些技术所用的化石能源、生物质能等燃料，还包括投资资本性支出的资金机会成本。"],

["User driven model, not market based.","用户驱动而非市场驱动模型。"],
["The Global Calculator is an engineering based model, not an economic one.

["Costs are exogenous.","成本外生化。"],
["For most technologies, costs decline over time as they follow a learning curve.  However, because the model is user driven, not market based, costs are exogenous: for example, the cost of an electric vehicle in 2030 in the tool is fixed regardless of whether there is a high or low deployment of electric vehicles in that year. However if the user has beliefs about how they would expect the unit costs of particular technologies to change in their pathway, they can sensitivity test the effect of varying these assumptions in the underlying spreadsheet.","对大部分技术而言，由于经验曲线的存在，成本在一段时间内会有所下降。但由于模型是用户驱动，而不是市场驱动，成本是外生化的：例如，2030年，电动车的成本是固定的，不管电动车的部署是多是少。然后，如果用户对自身路径中特定技术的单位成本变化有想法，他们可以在下层电子数据表中测试调整这些预测会带来怎样的结果。"],
["US cost assumption.","美国成本预测。"],
["The cost estimates are calculated assuming the whole world faces US technology prices.  This simplifying assumption is made because the Global Calculator does not model individual countries.  It is not clear whether this will tend to over or underestimate total costs because in countries where capital costs are higher, operating costs are usually correspondingly lower.","成本估计的基础是假设美国技术价格适用于世界。作出这一简化的原因是全球计算器不以单独的国家为模型。这是否会造成在一些资金成本高、运行成本相对低的国家，总成本被高估或低估还不得而知。"],
["Fuel costs are particularly uncertain.","燃料成本尤其具有不确定性。"],
["Average and marginal fossil fuel extraction costs and average tax rates levied by oil exporting countries in 2050 are extremely uncertain.

["Some costs are missing.","一些成本数据丢失。"],
["Unfortunately we could not include some costs. This was either owing to time, uncertainty or the potential negligible nature of costs. It was not possible to estimate costs for insulation, transport efficiency, appliance efficiency, fossil fuel efficiency and the greenhouse gas removal levers. For individual technologies we did not include costs for nuclear decommissioning as it is uncertain whether decommissioning would occur before 2050.","可惜我们不能将一些成本包括在内，原因不是因为时间、不确定性或成本本身潜在的易被忽略性。一些条目的成本，如孤立条目、运输效率、家电效率、化石能源效率和温室气体削减都无法预测。我们没有将核除役的成本包括到单独技术的成本中，因为2050年前核除役是否能实现还不得而知。"],
["It is difficult to estimate the total energy system cost without double counting.","预测能源系统总成本时很难避免重复计算。"],
["The costs of a car, counted in the transport costs, will include the cost of electricity used in the production of the car. The cost of the electricity is also counted in the power sector costs.

["Please note: we recognise that the 2011 emission intensity value for cement is lower than other sources such as the IEA. Total cement emissions include “process emissions” and “combustion emissions”. Our combustions emissions are based on the energy combusted in cement production multiplied by the respective emission factors in the Global Calculator. The emissions intensity may be too low because the emissions factors for fuel combustion in the industry sector are based on a global average emissions factor across all sectors. In reality, the global average across all sectors must be lower than the global average for manufacturing sector. The global calculator uses this simple approach to make the model less complex – one emissions factor for all solid hydrocarbons, rather than emissions  factors for all types of solid fuels for each sub sector.","请注意：我们注意到2011年水泥行业的碳排放强度低于其他来源，如IEA给出的数据。水泥碳排放总量包括“过程排放”和“燃烧排放”。我们得出的燃烧排放量基于水泥生产过程中消耗的能量乘以全球计算器中的相关排放因子。碳排放强度可能过低的原因是工业部门中燃料燃烧的碳排放因子是基于各个行业的全球平均排放量因素，而事实上这一平均值是低于制造业全球平均值的。全球计算器利用这一途径来简化模型——固体碳氢化合物只受一种排放因子影响，而不是各种排放因子对应各分部门的固体燃料。"],
